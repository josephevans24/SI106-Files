	My final project was two classes; a Shannon Game Guesser, and a Text information one. The Shannon Game Guesser will take two files or text as an input. One of those files is what will be guesses and the other file used are what create the rules. The rules determine the accuracy of the Shannon Game Guesser. There are two rules that are made from this, one that looks at the past letter and guesses the next one based on how frequently it appears in the rules text. The other rule is one that looks at the past two letters to make the guess of the next letter based on how frequently it appears after those two letters. I found the past letter rules to be more accurate than the past two letter rule. I am submitting two text files that I was interested in comparing for their accuracy. The first is a plain text of my favorite classic novel, A Tale of Two Cities. The second is a CSV file of all my text messages. It is interesting to see the variance in accuracy between the language of the past with Dickens and my modern ‘shortened’ messages through text. When using this code, I would recommend a large text file to make the rules, otherwise you might not have every character you need and it will return an error. In addition, the larger your text file the more accurate it generally is!
	The other class, TextInformation will tell you a variety of fun facts about a text file you’re interested in. Anything from the most frequent word and letter to the count of how many times a certain word appears to the top five most used words in the text. This is a class that’s fun to play around with to gather simple data about a text file.
	To use this code you need to install the CSV module, this will enable the code to properly read through CSV files. I hope you have fun playing around with the project and seeing just how predictable certain texts are!
