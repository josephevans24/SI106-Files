This is a plain text file, with no formatting. 

I just created it so that you can see what the unix commands
more and ls do.

It has a lot of lines.

That way, it won't all fit on one screen.

When it fills the screen, there will be a : at the bottom left, 
to indicate that there is more stuff on another screen.

If you press the down arrow, you'll go to the next line.
Press page down or space to move down by a whole screenful.

Press the up arrow to go back up a line,
or page up go back up a screenful.

And press q to quit.

Extra line

More lines, so that it won't fit on one screen.

Hopefully, your terminal window won't be so big that you can
fit this whole file on one screen! 

I'm adding more silly lines.

Don't expect anything interesting.
