# Get these from the Twitter website, by going to
# https://apps.twitter.com/ and creating an "app"
# Don't fill in a callback_url and put in a placeholder for the website
# Visit the Keys and Access Tokens tab for your app and grab the following two values

client_key = 'LTP1SaXpgvQuGBqzm3keevvu5' # what Twitter calls Consumer Key
client_secret = 'AWq6pdCRjEB7HWGCt5mlPhCGMpvuohCkqH9754yWXxHitUbfBv' # What Twitter calls Consumer Secret


def get_tokens():
    ## Step 1. Obtain a request token which will identify you (the client) in the next step. At this stage you will only need your client key and secret

    # OAuth1Session is a class defined in the requests_oauthlib module
    # Two values are passed to the __init__ method of OAuth1Session
    # -- the value of client_key is passed as the value of the first parameter (whose name we don't know)
    # -- the value of client_secret is passed as the value of the parameter that is also called client_secret
    # after this line executes, oauth will now be an instance of the class OAuth1Session
    oauth = requests_oauthlib.OAuth1Session(client_key, client_secret=client_secret)

    request_token_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token'

    # invoke the fetch_request_token method
    # it returns a dictionary that might look like this:
    # {
    #     "oauth_token": "Z6eEdO8MOmk394WozF5oKyuAv855l4Mlqo7hhlSLik",
    #     "oauth_token_secret": "Kd75W4OQfb2oJTV0vzGzeXftVAwgMnEK9MumzYcM"
    # }
    # It also saves the oauth_token as an instance variable of the object
    # oauth is bound to, so it can be used in later steps
    fetch_response = oauth.fetch_request_token(request_token_url)

    # pull the two values out of the dictionary and store them in variable for later use
    # note that d.get('somekey') is another way of writing d['somekey']
    resource_owner_key = fetch_response.get('oauth_token')
    resource_owner_secret = fetch_response.get('oauth_token_secret')


    
    ## Step 2. Obtain authorization from the user (resource owner) to access their protected resources (images, tweets, etc.). This is commonly done by redirecting the user to a specific url to which you add the request token as a query parameter. Note that not all services will give you a verifier even if they should. Also the oauth_token given here will be the same as the one in the previous step.
    base_authorization_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize'
    # append the query parameters need to make it a full url.
    # they will include the resource_owner_key from the previus step,
    # which was stored in the oauth object above as an instance variable
    # when fetch_request_token was invoked
    authorization_url = oauth.authorization_url(base_authorization_url)

    webbrowser.open(authorization_url)

    # After the user authenticates at Twitter, it would normally "redirect"
    # the browser back to our website. But we aren't running a website.
    # Some services, like Twitter, will let you configure the app to 
    # display a verifier, or the entire redirect url, rather than actually
    # redirecting to it.
    # User will have to cut and paste the verifier or the whole redirect url

    # version where the website provides a verifier
    verifier = raw_input('Please input the verifier')

    # version where the website provides the entire redirect url
    redirect_response = raw_input('https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize')
    oauth_response = oauth.parse_authorization_response(redirect_response)
    # get back something like this
    #{
    #    "oauth_token": "Z6eEdO8MOmk394WozF5oKyuAv855l4Mlqo7hhlSLik",
    #    "oauth_verifier": "sdflk3450FASDLJasd2349dfs"
    #}
    verifier = oauth_response.get('oauth_verifier')


    ## Step 3. Obtain an access token from the OAuth provider. Save this token as it can be re-used later. In this step we will re-use most of the credentials obtained uptil this point.

    # make a new instance of OAuth1Session, with several more parameters filled in
    oauth = requests_oauthlib.OAuth1Session(client_key,
                              client_secret=client_secret,
                              resource_owner_key=resource_owner_key,
                              resource_owner_secret=resource_owner_secret,
                              verifier=verifier)
                              
    access_token_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token'
    oauth_tokens = oauth.fetch_access_token(access_token_url)
    # get back something like this
    #{
    #    "oauth_token": "6253282-eWudHldSbIaelX7swmsiHImEL4KinwaGloHANdrY",
    #    "oauth_token_secret": "2EEfA6BG3ly3sR3RjE0IBSnlQu4ZrUzPiYKmrkVU"
    #}
    resource_owner_key = oauth_tokens.get('oauth_token')
    resource_owner_secret = oauth_tokens.get('oauth_token_secret')
    
    return (client_key, client_secret, resource_owner_key, resource_owner_secret, verifier)

try:
    # See if you can read the credentials from the file
    # (If you have credentials for the wrong user, or expired credentials
    # just delete the file creds.txt
    f = open("creds.txt", 'r')
    (client_key, client_secret, resource_owner_key, resource_owner_secret, verifier) = json.loads(f.read())
    f.close()
except:
    # If not, you'll have to get them
    # and then save them in creds.txt
    tokens = get_tokens()
    f = open("creds.txt", 'w')
    f.write(json.dumps(tokens))
    f.close()
    (client_key, client_secret, resource_owner_key, resource_owner_secret, verifier) = tokens
  
## Step 4. Access protected resources. 

# For endpoints that might be interesting to try, see
# https://dev.twitter.com/rest/tools/console and
# https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public
protected_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/settings.json'
oauth = requests_oauthlib.OAuth1Session(client_key,
                        client_secret=client_secret,
                        resource_owner_key=resource_owner_key,
                        resource_owner_secret=resource_owner_secret)

# Call the get method. The work of encoding the client_secret 
# and "signing" the request is taken care of behind the scenes.
# The results are also processed for you, including calling .read() and 
# encoding as json.
r = oauth.get(protected_url)
# r is now an instance of the Response class in the requests module
# documentation at 
# http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#response-content

# Of particular interest to us is the json() method of the Response class
print pretty(r.json())


####PAGING
# Getting multiple pages of results can be tricky. See Twitter's explanation at
# https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/timelines
# (Other sites handle paging slightly differently; you'll have to read the documentation)

# Let's get my last 25 tweets, 5 at a time, accumulating all the tweet ids.
# Twitter actually lets you get 25 at a time, but not more than 200, so this
# is practice for when you want to get more than 200.

# To pass parameters using the requests_oauthlib module, we use the same 
# get() method used in the requests module. It combines some of the functions
# we were doing separately before with urllib2.urlopen and urllib.urlencode.
# see documentation at 
# http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls

ids = []
max_id = None
my_params = {'count' : 5}
for i in range(5):
    if len(ids) > 0:
        #Twitter suggests that you take the minimum of the ids you got before, 
        #then subtract one from it, to make sure you get only ones you haven't
        #received before. We can use the built-in min function (or accumulate by hand). 
        my_params['max_id'] = min(ids) - 1
        r = oauth.get("https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json", params= {'q': 'Jim Harbaugh', 'count': 1})
        # params = my_params)  # passes {'count': 5, 'max_id': whatever} or just {'count':5} the first tiem
        ids = ids + [tweet['id'] for tweet in r.json()]
print ids



r = oauth.get("https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json", 
                params = {'q': 'University of Michigan', 'count' : 3})
print type(r.json())
# print json.dumps(r.json(), indent=2)
res = r.json()
print res.keys()

pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=2)
