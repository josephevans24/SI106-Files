I Am Number Four 
Pittacus Lore 



THE EVENTS IN THIS BOOK ARE REAL. 



NAMES AND PLACES HAVE BEEN CHANGED 
TO PROTECT THE LORIEN SIX, 
WHO REMAIN IN HIDING. 



TAKE THIS AS YOUR FIRST WARNING. 



OTHER CIVILIZATIONS DO EXIST. 



SOME OF THEM SEEK TO DESTROY YOU. 



THE DOOR STARTS SHAKING. IT'S A FLIMSY THING made of bamboo shoots held together 
with tattered lengths of twine. The shake is subtle and stops almost immediately. They lift their heads to 
listen, a fourteen-year-old boy and a fifty-year-old man, who ev eryone thinks is his father but who was 
born near a different jungle on a different planet hundreds of lightyears away. They are lying shirtless on 
opposite sides of the hut, a mosquito net over each cot. They hear a distant crash, like the sound of an 
animal breaking the branch of a tree, but in this case, it sounds like the entire tree has been broken. 

"What was that?" the boy asks. 
"Shh," the man replies. 



They hear the chirp of insects, nothing more. The man brings his legs over the side of the cot when the 
shake starts again. A longer, firmer shake, and another crash, this time closer. The man gets to his feet 
and walks slowly to the door. Silence. The man takes a deep breath as he inches his hand to the latch. 
The boy sits up. 

"No," the man whispers, and in that instant the blade of a sword, long and gleaming, made of a shining 
white metal that is not found on Earth, comes through the door and sinks deeply into the man's chest. It 
protrudes six inches out through his back, and is quickly pulled free. The man grunts. The boy gasps. The 
man takes a single breath, and utters one word: "Run." He falls lifeless to the floor. 

The boy leaps from the cot, bursts through the rear wall. He doesn't bother with the door or a window; 
he literally runs through the wall, which breaks apart as if it's paper, though it's made of strong, hard 
African mahogany. He tears into the Congo night, leaps over trees, sprints at a speed somewhere 
around 

sixty miles per hour. His sight and hearing are beyond human. He dodges trees, rips through snarled 
vines, leaps small streams with a single step. Heavy footsteps are close behind him, getting closer every 
second. His pursuers also have gifts. And they have something with them. Something he has only heard 
hints of, something he nev er believed he would see on Earth. 

The crashing nears. The boy hears a low, intense roar. He knows whatever is behind him is picking up 
speed. He sees a break in the jungle up ahead. When he reaches it, he sees a huge ravine, three hundred 
feet across and three hundred feet down, with a river at the bottom. The river's bank is covered with 
huge boulders. Boulders that would break him apart if he fell on them. His only chance is to get across 
the ravine. He'll have a short running start, and one chance. One chance to save his own life. Even for 
him, or for any of the others on Earth like him, it's a near impossible leap. Going back, or going down, or 
trying to fight them means certain death. He has one shot. 

There's a deafening roar behind him. They're twenty, thirty feet away. He takes five steps back and 
runsâ€”and just before the ledge, he takes off and starts flying across the ravine. He's in the air three or 
four seconds. He screams, his arms outstretched in front of him, waiting for either safety or the end. He 
hits the ground and tumbles forward, stopping at the base of a mammoth tree. He smiles. He can't 
believe he made it, that he's going to survive. Not wanting them to see him, and knowing he needs to 
get 

farther away from them, he stands. He'll have to keep running. 

He turns towards the jungle. As he does, a huge hand wraps itself around his throat. He is lifted off the 
ground. He struggles, kicks, tries to pull away, but knows it's futile, that it's over. He should have 
expected that they'd be on both sides, that once they found him, there would be no escape. The 
Mogadorian lifts him so that he can see the boy's chest, see the amulet that is hanging around his neck, 
the amulet that only he and his kind can wear. He tears it off and puts it somewhere inside the long 
black 



cloak he is wearing, and when his hand emerges it is holding the gleaming white metal sword. The boy 
looks into the Mogadorian's deep, wide, emotionless black eyes, and he speaks. 

"The Legacies live. They will find each other, and when they're ready, they're going to destroy you." 

The Mogadarian laughs, a nasty, mocking laugh. It raises the sword, the only weapon in the universe 
that 

can break the charm that until today protected the boy, and still protects the others. The blade ignites in 
a 

silver flame as it points to the sky, as if it's coming alive, sensing its mission and grimacing in 
anticipation. 

And as it falls, an arc of light speeding through the blackness of the jungle, the boy still believes that 
some 

part of him will survive, and some part of him will make it home. He closes his eyes just before the 
sword 

strikes. And then it is over. 



CHAPTER ONE 

IN THE BEGINNING THERE WERE NINE OF US. We left when we were young, almost too young 
to remember. 

Almost. 

I am told the ground shook, that the skies were full of light and explosions. We were in that two-week 
period of the year when both moons hang on opposite sides of the horizon. It was a time of celebration, 
and the explosions were at first mistaken for fireworks. They were not. It was warm, a soft wind blew in 
from off the water. I am always told the weather: it was warm. There was a soft wind. I've never 
understood why that matters. 

What I remember most vividly is the way my grandmother looked that day. She was frantic, and sad. 
There were tears in her eyes. My grandfather stood just over her shoulder. I remember the way his 
glasses gathered the light from the sky. There were hugs. There were words said by each of them. I don't 
remember what they were. Nothing haunts me more. 

It took a year to get here. I was five when we arrived. We were to assimilate ourselves into the culture 
before returning to Lorien when it could again sustain life. The nine of us had to scatter, and go our own 
ways. For how long, nobody knew. We still don't. None of them know where I am, and I don't know 
where they are, or what they look like now. That is how we protect ourselves because of the charm that 



was placed upon us when we left, a charm guaranteeing that we can only be killed in the order of our 
numbers, so long as we stay apart. If we come together, then the charm is broken. 

When one of us is found and killed, a circular scar wraps around the right ankle of those still alive. And 
residing on our left ankle, formed when the Loric charm was first cast, is a small scar identical to the 
amulet each of us wears. The circular scars are another part of the charm. A warning system so that we 
know where we stand with each other, and so that we know when they'll be coming for us next. The 
first 

scar came when I was nine years old. It woke me from my sleep, burning itself into my flesh. We were 
living in Arizona, in a small border town near Mexico. I woke screaming in the middle of the night, in 
agony, terrified as the scar seared itself into my flesh. It was the first sign that the Mogadorians had 
finally 

found us on Earth, and the first sign that we were in danger. Until the scar showed up, I had almost 
convinced myself that my memories were wrong, that what Henri told me was wrong. I wanted to be a 
normal kid living a normal life, but I knew then, beyond any doubt or discussion, that I wasn't. We 
moved to Minnesota the next day. 

The second scar came when I was twelve. I was in school, in Colorado, participating in a spelling bee. 
As soon as the pain started I knew what was happening, what had happened to Number Two. The pain 
was excruciating, but bearable this time. I would have stayed on the stage, but the heat lit my sock on 
fire. The teacher who was conducting the bee sprayed me with a fire extinguisher and rushed me to the 
hospital. The doctor in the ER found the first scar and called the police. When Henri showed, they 
threatened to arrest him for child abuse. But because he hadn't been anywhere near me when the 
second 

scar came, they had to let him go. We got in the car and drove away, this time to Maine. We left 
everything we had except for the Loric Chest that Henri brought along on every move. All twenty-one of 
them to date. 

The third scar appeared an hour ago. I was sitting on a pontoon boat. The boat belonged to the parents 
of the most popular kid at my school, and unbeknownst to them, he was having a party on it. I had never 
been invited to any of the parties at my school before. I had always, because I knew we might leave at 
any minute, kept to myself. But it had been quiet for two years. Henri hadn't seen anything in the news 
that might lead the Mogadorians to one of us, or might alert us to them. So I made a couple friends. And 
one of them introduced me to the kid who was having the party. Everyone met at a dock. There were 
three coolers, some music, girls I had admired from afar but never spoken to, even though I wanted to. 
We pulled out from the dock and went half a mile into the Gulf of Mexico. I was sitting on the edge of 
the 

pontoon with my feet in the water, talking to a cute, dark-haired, blue-eyed girl named Tara, when I felt 
it 

coming. The water around my leg started boiling, and my lower leg started glowing where the scar was 
imbedding itself. The third of the Lorien symbols, the third warning. Tara started screaming and people 
started crowding around me. I knew there was no way to explain it. And I knew we would have to leave 



immediately. 

The stakes were higher now. They had found Number Three, wherever he or she was, and Number 
Three was dead. So I calmed Tara down and kissed her on the cheek and told her it was nice to meet 
her and that I hoped she had a long beautiful life. I dove off the side of the boat and started swimming, 
underwater the entire time, except for one breath about halfway there, as fast as I could until I reached 
the shore. I ran along the side of the highway, just inside of the tree line, moving at speeds as fast as any 
of the cars. When I got home, Henri was at the bank of scanners and monitors that he used to research 
news around the world, and police activ ity in our area. He knew without me saying a word, though he 
did lift my soaking pants to see the scars. 



In the beginning we were a group of nine. 
Three are gone, dead. 
There are six of us left. 

They are hunting us, and they won't stop until they've killed us all. 
I am Number Four. 
I know that I am next. 



CHAPTER TWO 

I STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVE AND STAREup at the house. It is light pink, almost like 
cake frosting, sitting ten feet above the ground on wooden stilts. A palm tree sways in the front. In the 
back of the house a pier extends twenty yards into the Gulf of Mexico. If the house were a mile to the 
south, the pier would be in the Atlantic Ocean. 

Henri walks out of the house carrying the last of the boxes, some of which were never unpacked from 
our last move. He locks the door, then leaves the keys in the mail slot beside it. It is two o'clock in the 
morning. He is wearing khaki shorts and a black polo. He is very tan, with an unshaven face that seems 
downcast. He is also sad to be leaving. He tosses the final boxes into the back of the truck with the rest 
of our things. 



"That's it," he says. 



I nod. We stand and stare up at the house and listen to the wind come through the palm fronds. I am 
holding a bag of celery in my hand. 

"I'll miss this place," I say. "Even more than the others." 

"Me too." 

"Time for the burn?" 

"Yes. You want to do it, or you want me to?" 
Til doit." 

Henri pulls out his wallet and drops it on the ground. I pull out mine and do the same. He walks to our 
truck and comes back with passports, birth certificates, social security cards, checkbooks, credit cards 
and bank cards, and dr ops them on the ground. All of the documents and materials related to our 
identities here, all of them forged and manufactured. I grab from the truck a small gas can we keep for 
emergencies. I pour the gas ov er the small pile. My current name is Daniel Jones. My story is that I grew 
up in California and moved here because of my dad's job as a computer programmer. Daniel Jones is 
about to disappear. I light a match and drop it, and the pile ignites. Another one of my lives, gone. As we 
always do, Henri and I stand and watch the fire. Bye, Daniel, I think,it was nice knowing you. When the 
fire burns down, Henri looks over at me. 

"We gotta go." 

"I know." 

"These islands were never safe. They're too hard to leave quickly, too hard to escape from. It was 
foolish of us to come here." 

I nod. He is right, and I know it. But I'm still reluctant to leave. We came here because I wanted to, and 
for the first time, Henri let me choose where we were going. We've been here nine months, and it's the 
longest we have stayed in any one place since leaving Lorien. I'll miss the sun and the warmth. I'll miss 
the gecko that watched from the wall each morning as I ate breakfast. Though there are literally millions 
of geckos in south Florida, I swear this one follows me to school and seems to be ev erywhere I am. I'll 
miss the thunderstorms that seem to come from out of nowhere, the way everything is still and quiet in 
the 

early-morning hours before the terns arrive. I'll miss the dolphins that sometimes feed when the sun 
sets. 

I'll even miss the smell of sulfur from the rotting seaweed at the base of the shore, the way that it fills 
the 



house and penetrates our dreams while we sleep. 

"Get rid of the celery and I'll wait in the truck," Henri says. "Then it's time." 

I enter a thicket of trees off to the right of the truck. There are three Key deer already waiting. I dump 
the bag of celery out at their feet and crouch down and pet each of them in turn. They allow me to, 
having long gotten over their skittishness. One of them raises his head and looks at me. Dark, blank eyes 
staring back. It almost feels as though he passes something to me. A shudder runs up my spine. He drops 
his head and continues eating. 

"Good luck, little friends," I say, and walk to the truck and climb into the passenger seat. 

We watch the house grow smaller in the side mirrors until Henri pulls onto the main road and the house 
disappears. It's a Saturday. I wonder what's happening at the party without me. What they're saying 
about the way that I left and what they'll say on Monday when I'm not at school. I wish I could have said 
good-bye. I'll nev er see anyone I knew here ever again. I'll never speak to any of them. And they'll 
never know what I am or why I left. After a few months, or maybe a few weeks, none of them will 
probably ever think of me again. 

Before we get on the highway, Henri pulls over to gas up the truck. As he works the pump, I start 
looking through an atlas he keeps on the middle of the seat. We've had the atlas since we arrived on this 
planet. It has lines drawn to and from every place we've ever lived. At this point, there are lines 
crisscrossing all of the United States. We know we should get rid of it, but it's really the only piece of our 
life together that we have. Normal people have photos and videos and journals; we have the atlas. 
Picking it up and looking through it, I can see Henri has drawn a new line from Florida to Ohio. When I 
think of Ohio, I think of cows and corn and nice people. I know the license plate saysTHE HEART OF 
IT ALL . What "All" is, I don't know, but I guess I'll find out. 

Henri gets back into the truck. He has bought a couple of sodas and a bag of chips. He pulls away and 
starts heading toward U.S. 1, which will take us north. He reaches for the atlas. 

"Do you think there are people in Ohio?" I joke. 

He chuckles. "I would imagine there are a few. And we might even get lucky and find cars and TV 
there, too." 

I nod. Maybe it won't be as bad as I think. 

"What do you think of the name v John Smith'?" I ask. 



"Is that what you've settled on?" 



"I think so," I say. I've never been a John before, or a Smith. 

"It doesn't get any more common than that. I would say it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Smith." 
I smile. "Yeah, I think I like v John Smith.'" 
"I'll create your forms when we stop." 

A mile later we are off the island and cruising across the bridge. The waters pass below us. They are 
calm and the moonlight is shimmering on the small waves, creating dapples of white in the crests. On 
the 

right is the ocean, on the left is the gulf; it is, in essence, the same water, but with two different names. I 
have the urge to cry, but I don't. It's not that I'm necessarily sad to leave Florida, but I'm tired of 
running. I'm tired of dreaming up a new name ev ery six months. Tired of new houses, new schools. I 
wonder if it'll ever be possible for us to stop. 



CHAPTER THREE 

WE PULL OFF FOR FOOD AND GAS AND NEW PHONES. We go to a truck stop, where we eat 
meat loaf and macaroni and cheese, which is one of the few things Henri acknowledges as being 
superior 

to anything we had on Lorien. As we eat, he creates new documents on his laptop, using our new 
names. 

He'll print them when we arrive, and as far as anyone will know, we'll be who we say we are. 

"You're sure about John Smith?" he says. 

"Yeah." 

"You were born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama." 
I laugh. "How did you come up with that?" 

He smiles and motions towards two women sitting a few booths away. Both of them are extremely hot. 
One of them is wearing a T-shirt that readsWE DO IT BETTER IN TUSCALOOSA . 



"And that's where we're going next," he says. 



"As weird as it may sound, I hope we stay in Ohio for a long time." 
"Really. You like the idea of Ohio?" 

"I like the idea of making some friends, of going to the same school for more than a few months, of 
maybe actually having a life. I started to do it in Florida. It was sort of great, and for the first time since 
we've been on Earth, I felt almost normal. I want to find somewhere and stay somewhere." 

Henri looks thoughtful. "Have you looked at your scars today?" 

"No, why?" 

"Because this isn't about you. This is about the survival of our race, which was almost entirely 
obliterated, and about keeping you alive. Every time one of us diesâ€”every time one ofyou , the Garde, 
diesâ€”our chances diminish. You're Number Four; you're next in line. You have an entire race of vicious 
murderers hunting you. We're leaving at the first sign of trouble, and I'm not going to debate it with 
you." 

Henri drives the entire time. Between breaks and the creation of the new documents, it takes about 
thirty 

hours. I spend most of the time napping or playing video games. Because of my reflexes, I can master 
most of the games quickly. The longest it has taken me to beat any of them is about a day. I like the alien 
war and space games the best. I pretend I'm back on Lorien, fighting Mogadorians, cutting them down, 
turning them to ash. Henri thinks it's weird and tries to discourage me from doing it. He says we need to 
live in the real world, where war and death are a reality, not pretend. As I finish my latest game, I look 
up. I'm tired of sitting in the truck. The clock on the dash reads 7:58. 1 yawn, wipe my eyes. 

"How much farther?" 

"We're almost there," Henri says. 

It is dark out, but there is a pale glow to the west. We pass by farms with horses and cattle, then barren 
fields, and beyond those, it's trees as far as the eye can see. This is exactly what Henri wanted, a quiet 
place to go unnoticed. Once a week he scours the internet for six, seven, eight hours at a time to update 
a list of available homes around the country that fit his criteria: isolated, rural, immediate availability. He 
told me it took four triesâ€” one call to South Dakota, one to New Mexico, one to Arkansasâ€” until he 
had the rental where we're going to live now. 

A few minutes later we see scattered lights that announce the town. We pass a sign that reads: 



WELCOME TO PARADISE, OHIO POPULATION 5,243 



"Wow," I say. "This place is even smaller than where we stayed in Montana." 
Henri is smiling. "Who do you think it's paradise for?" 
"Cows, maybe? Scarecrows?" 

We pass by an old gas station, a car wash, a cemetery. Then the houses begin, clapboard houses 
spaced thirty or so feet apart. Halloween decorations hang in the windows of most of them. A sidewalk 
cuts through small yards leading to the front doors. A traffic circle sits in the center of town, and in the 
middle of it is a statue of a man on horseback holding a sword. Henri stops. We both look at it and 
laugh, though we're laughing because we hope no one else with swords ever shows up here. He 
continues around the circle and once we're through it, the dashboard GPS system tells us to make a 
turn. 

We begin heading west, out of town. 

We drive for four miles before turning left onto a gravel road, then pass open cut fields that are 
probably 

full of corn in the summer, then through a dense forest for about a mile. And then we find it, tucked 

away 

in overgrown vegetation, a rusted silver mailbox with black lettering painted on the side of it that reads 
17 

OLD MILL RD . 

"The closest house is two miles away," he says, tur ning in. Weeds grow throughout the gravel drive, 
which is littered with potholes filled with tawny water. He comes to a stop and turns the truck off. 

"Whose car is that?" I ask, nodding to the black SUV Henri has just parked behind. 

"I'm assuming the real-estate agent's." 

The house stands silhouetted by trees. In the dark there is an eerie look to it, like whoever last lived in it 
was scared away, or was driven away, or ran away. I get out of the truck. The engine ticks and I can feel 
the heat coming off of it. I grab my bag from the bed and stand there holding it. 

"What do you think?" Henri asks. 

The house is one story. Wooden clapboard. Most of the white paint has been chipped away. One of the 
front windows is broken. The roof is covered with black shingles that look warped and brittle. Three 



wooden stairs lead to a small porch covered with rickety chairs. The yard itself is long and shaggy. It's 
been a very long time since the grass was last mowed. 

"It looks like Paradise," I say. 

We walk up together. As we do, a well-dressed blond woman around Henri's age comes out of the 
doorway. She's wearing a business suit and is holding a clipboard and folder; a BlackBerry is clipped to 
the waist of her skirt. She smiles. 

"Mr. Smith?" 

"Yes," says Henri. 

"I'm Annie Hart, the agent from Paradise Realty. We spoke on the phone. I tried calling you earlier but 
your phone seemed to be turned off." 

"Yes, of course. The battery unfortunately died on the way here." 

"Ah, I just hate when that happens," she says, and walks towards us and shakes Henri's hand. She asks 
me my name and I tell her, though I am tempted, as I always am, to just say "Four." As Henri signs the 
lease she asks me how old I am and tells me she has a daughter at the local high school about my age. 
She's very warm, friendly, and clearly loves to chat. Henri hands the lease back and the three of us walk 
into the house. 

Inside most of the furniture is covered with white sheets. Those that aren't covered are coated with a 
thick layer of dust and dead insects. The screens in the windows look brittle to the touch, and the walls 
are covered with cheap plywood paneling. There are two bedrooms, a modest-sized kitchen with lime 
green linoleum, one bathroom. The living room is large and rectangular, situated at the front of the 
house. 

There's a fireplace in the far corner. I walk through and toss my bag on the bed of the smaller room. 
There is a huge faded poster of a football player wearing a bright orange uniform. He's in the middle of 
throwing a pass, and it looks like he's about to get crushed by a massive man in a black and gold 
uniform. It saysBERNIE KOSAR , QU ARTERB ACK CLEVELAND BROWNS . 

"Come say good-bye to Mrs. Hart," Henri yells from the living room. 

Mrs. Hart is standing at the door with Henri. She tells me I should look for her daughter at school, that 
maybe we could be friends. I smile and say yes, that would be nice. After she leaves we immediately 
start unpacking the truck. Depending on how quickly we leave a place, we either travel very 
lightlyâ€”meaning the clothes on our back, Henri's laptop and the intricately carved Loric Chest that goes 
everywhere with us â€”or we bring a few things â€”usually Henri's extra computers and equipment, which 
he uses to set up a security perimeter and search the web for news and events that might be related to 



us. 

This time we have the Chest, the two high-powered computers, four TV monitors, and four cameras. We 
also have some clothes, though not many of the clothes we wore in Florida are appropriate for life in 
Ohio. Henri carries the Chest to his room, and we lug all of the equipment into the basement, where 
he'll 

set it up so no visitors will see it. Once everything is inside, he starts placing the cameras and turning on 
the monitors. 

"We won't have the internet here until the morning. But if you want to go to school tomorrow, I can 
print 

all of your new documents for you." 

"If I stay will I have to help you clean this place and finish the setup?" 
"Yes." 

"I'll go to school," I say. 

"Then you better get a good night's sleep." 



CHAPTER FOUR 

ANOTHER NEW IDENTITY, ANOTHER NEW SCHOOL.I've lost track of how many there have 
been over the years. Fifteen? Twenty? Always a small town, a small school, always the same routine. 
New students draw attention. Sometimes I question our strategy of sticking to the small towns because 
it's hard, almost impossible, to go unnoticed. But I know Henri's rationale: it is impossible forthem to go 
unnoticed as well. 

The school is three miles away from our house. Henri drives me in the morning. It's smaller than most of 
the others I've attended and is unimpressive looking, one story, long and low-slung. A mural of a pirate 
with a knife between his teeth covers the outside wall beside the front door. 

"So you're a Pirate now?" Henri says beside me. 

"It looks like it," I reply. 

"You know the drill," he says. 



"This ain't my first rodeo." 



"Don't show your intelligence. It'll make them resent you." 



"Wouldn't dream of it." 

"Don't stand out or draw too much attention." 

"Just a fly on the wall." 

"And don't hurt anybody. You're far stronger than they are." 
"I know." 

"Most importantly, always be ready. Ready to leave at a moment's notice. What's in your backpack?" 

"Five days' worth of dried fruit and nuts. Spare socks and thermal underwear. Rain jacket. A handheld 
GPS. A knife disguised as a pen." 

"On you at all times." He takes a deep breath. "And keep an eye out for signs. Your Legacies are going 
to appear any day now. Hide them at all costs and call me immediately." 

"I know, Henri." 

"Any day, John," he reiterates. "If your fingers start to disappear, or if you start to float, or shake 
violently, if you lose muscular control or begin to hear v oices even when nobody is talking. Anything at 
all, you call." 

I pat my bag. "Got my phone right here." 

"I'll be waiting here after school. Good luck in there, kiddo," he says. 

I smile at him. He is fifty years old, which means he was forty when we arrived. Being his age made for a 
harder transition. He still speaks with a strong Loric accent that is often mistaken for French. It was a 
good alibi in the beginning, so he named himself Henri, and he has stuck with it ever since, just changing 
his last name to match mine. 

"Off I go to rule the school," I say. 

"Be good." 



I walk towards the building. As is the case with most high schools, there are crowds of kids hanging 
around outside. They're divided into their cliques, the jocks and the cheerleaders, the band kids carrying 



instruments, the brains in their glasses with their textbooks and BlackBerries, the stoners off to one side, 
oblivious to everyone else. One kid, gangly with thick glasses, stands alone. He's wearing a black NASA 
T-shirt and jeans, and can't weigh more than a hundred pounds. He has a handheld telescope and is 
scanning the sky, which is mostly obscured by clouds. I notice a girl taking pictures, moving easily from 
one group to the next. She's shockingly beautiful with straight blond hair past her shoulders, ivory skin, 
high cheekbones, and soft blue eyes. Everyone seems to know her and says hello to her, and no one 
objects to her taking their picture. 

She sees me, smiles and waves. I wonder why and turn to see if someone is behind me. There are, two 
kids discussing math homework, but no one else. I turn back around. The girl walks towards me, smiling. 
I've never seen a girl so good-looking, much less spoken to one, and I've definitely never had one wav e 
and smile as if we're friends. I'm immediately nervous, and start blushing. But I'm also suspicious, as I've 
been trained to be. As she nears me, she lifts the camera and starts snapping pictures. I raise my hands 
to 

block my face. She lowers the camera and smiles. 
"Don't be shy." 

"I'm not. Just trying to protect your lens. My face might break it." 
She laughs. "With that scowl it might. Try smiling." 

I smile, slightly. I'm so nervous I feel like I'm going to explode. I can feel my neck burning, my hands 
getting warm. 

"That's not a real smile," she says, teasingly. "A smile involves showing your teeth." 

I smile broadly and she takes pictures. I usually don't allow anyone to take my picture. If it ended up on 
the internet, or in a newspaper, it would make finding me much easier. The two times it happened, 
Henri 

was furious, got hold of the pictures, and destroyed them. If he knew I was doing this now, I'd be in 
huge trouble. I can't help it, thoughâ€”this girl is so pretty and so charming. As she's taking my picture, a 
dog comes running up to me. It's a beagle with tan floppy ears, white legs and chest, a slender black 
body. He's thin and dirty as if he's been living on his own. He rubs against my leg, whines, tries to get my 
attention. The girl thinks it's cute and has me kneel down so she can take a picture of me with the dog. 
As soon as she starts snapping shots, he backs away. Whenever she tries again, he moves farther away. 
She finally gives up and shoots a few more of me. The dog sits about thirty feet away watching us. 

"Do you know that dog?" she asks. 



"Never seen him before." 



"He sure likes you. You're John, right?" 

She holds out her hand. 

"Yeah." I say. "How'd you know?" 

"I'm Sarah Hart. My mother is your real-estate agent. She told me you'd probably be starting school 
today, and I should look out for you. You're the only new kid to show up today." 

I laugh. "Yeah, I met your mom. She was nice." 

"You gonna shake my hand?" 

She's still holding her hand out. I smile and take it, and it is literally one of the best feelings I've ev er had. 
"Wow," she says. 



"What?" 

"Your hand feels hot. Really hot, like you have a fever or something." 
"I don't think so." 
She lets go. 

"Maybe you're just warm-blooded." 
"Yeah, maybe." 

A bell rings in the distance and Sarah tells me that it's the warning bell. We have five minutes to get to 
class. We say good-bye and I watch her walk away. A moment later, something hits the back of my 
elbow. I turn and a group of football players, all wearing letterman jackets, sweep by me. One of them is 
glaring at me and I realize that he hit me with his backpack as he walked past. I doubt it was an accident 
and I start to follow them. I know I'm not going to do anything, even though I could. I just don't like 
bullies. As I do, the kid in the NASA shirt walks next to me. 

"I know you're new, so I'll fill you in," he says. 

"On what?" I ask. 



"That's Mark James. He's a big deal around here. His dad is the town sheriff and he's the star of the 



football team. He used to date Sarah, when she was a cheerleader, but she quit cheerleading and 
dumped him. He hasn't gotten over it. I wouldn't get involved if I were you." 

"Thanks." 

The kid hurries away. I make my way to the principal's office so I can register for classes and get 
started. I turn and look back to see if the dog is still around. He is, sitting in the same spot, watching me. 



The principal's name is Mr. Harris. He's fat and mostly bald, except for a few long hairs at the back and 
sides of his head. His belly reaches over his belt. His eyes are small and beady, set too close together. 
He grins at me from across the desk, and his smile seems to swallow his eyes. 

"So you're a sophomore from Santa Fe?" he asks. 

I nod, say yes even though we've nev er been to Santa Fe, or New Mexico, for that matter. A simple lie 
to keep from being traced. 

"That explains the tan. What brings you to Ohio?" 
"My dad's job." 

Henri isn't my father, but I always say he is to allay suspicion. In truth he is my Keeper, or what would 
be better understood on Earth as my guardian. On Lorien there were two types of citizens, those who 
develop Legacies, or powers, which can be extremely varied, anything from invisibility to the ability to 
read minds, from being able to fly to using natural forces like fire, wind or lightning. Those with the 

Legacies are called the Garde, and those without are called C pan, or Keepers. I am a member of the 
Garde. Henri is a C pan. Every Garde is assigned a C pan at an early age. C pans help us understand 

our planet's history and develop our powers. The C pan and the Gardeâ€”one group to run the planet, 
the other group to defend it. 

Mr. Harris nods. "And what does he do?" 

"He's a writer. He wanted to live in a small, quiet town to finish what he's working on," I say, which is 
our standard cover story. 

Mr. Harris nods and squints his eyes. "You look like a strong young man. Are you planning on playing 
sports here?" 



"I wish I could. I have asthma, sir," I say, my usual excuse to avoid any situation that might betray my 
strength and speed. 

"I'm sorry to hear that. We're always looking for able athletes for the football team," he says, and casts 
his eyes to the shelf on the wall, on top of which a football trophy sits engraved with last year's date. 
"We won the Pioneer Conference," he says, and beams with pride. 

He reaches over and pulls two sheets of paper from a file cabinet beside his desk and hands them to me. 
The first is my student schedule with a few open slots. The second is a list of the available electives. I 
choose classes and fill them in, then hand everything back. He gives me a sort of orientation, talking for 
what seems like hours, going over every page of the student manual with painstaking detail. One bell 
rings, then another. When he finally finishes he asks if I have any questions. I say no. 

"Excellent. There is a half hour left of second period, and you've chosen astronomy with Mrs. Burton. 
She's a great teacher, one of our very best. She won an award from the state once, signed by the 
governor himself." 

"That's great," I say. 

After Mr. Harris struggles to free himself from his chair, we leave his office and walk down the hall. His 
shoes click upon the newly waxed floor. The air smells of fresh paint and cleaner. Lockers line the walls. 
Many are covered with banners supporting the football team. There can't be more than twenty 
classrooms in the whole building. I count them as we pass. 

"Here we are," Mr. Harris says. He extends his hand. I shake it. "We're happy to have you. I like to 
think of us as a close-knit family. I'm glad to welcome you to it." 

"Thank you," I say. 

Mr. Harris opens the door and sticks his head in the classroom. Only then do I realize that I'm a little 
nervous, that a somewhat dizzy feeling is creeping in. My right leg is shaking; there are butterflies in the 
pit 

of my stomach. I don't understand why. Surely it's not the prospect of walking into my first class. I've 
done it far too many times to still feel the effect of nerves. I take a deep breath and try to shake them 
away. 

"Mrs. Burton, sorry to interrupt. Your new student is here." 

"Oh, great! Send him in," she says in a high-pitched voice of enthusiasm. 



Mr. Harris holds open the door and I walk through. The classroom is perfectly square, filled with 
twenty-five people, give or take, sitting at rectangular desks about the size of kitchen tables, three 
students to each. All eyes are on me. I look back at them before looking at Mrs. Burton. She is 
somewhere around sixty, wearing a pink wool sweater and red plastic glasses attached to a chain 
around 

her neck. She smiles widely, her hair graying and curly. My palms are sweaty and my face feels flushed. I 
hope it isn't red. Mr. Harris closes the door. 

"And what is your name?" she asks. 

In my unsettled mood I almost say "Daniel Jones" but catch myself. I take a deep breath and say, "John 
Smith." 

"Great! And where are you from?" 

"Flâ€” ," I begin, but then catch myself again before the word fully forms. "Santa Fe." 
"Class, let's give him a warm welcome." 

Everybody claps. Mrs. Burton motions for me to sit in the open seat in the middle of the room between 
two other students. I am relieved she doesn't ask any more questions. She turns around to go to her 
desk and I begin walking down the aisle, straight towards Mark James, who is sitting at a table with 
Sarah Hart. As I pass, he sticks his foot out and trips me. I lose my balance but stay upright. Snickers 
filter throughout the room. Mrs. Burton whips around. 

"What happened?" she asks. 

I don't answer her, and instead glare at Mark. Every school has one, a tough guy, a bully, whatever you 
want to call him, but never has one materialized this quickly. His hair is black, full of hair gel, carefully 
styled so it goes in all directions. He has meticulously trimmed sideburns, stubble on his face. Bushy 
eyebrows over a set of dark eyes. From his letterman jacket I see that he is a senior, and his name is 
written in gold cursive stitching above the year. Our eyes stay locked, and the class emits a taunting 
groan. 

I look to my seat three desks away, then I look back at Mark. I could literally break him in half if I 
wanted to. I could throw him into the next county. If he tried to run away, and got into a car, I could 
outrun his car and put it in the top of a tree. But aside from that being an extreme overreaction, Henri's 
words echo in my mind: "Don't stand out or draw too much attention." I know that I should follow his 
advice and ignore what has just happened, as I always have in the past. That is what we're good at, 
blending into the environment and living within its shadows. But I feel slightly off, uneasy, and before I 
have a chance to think twice, the question is already asked. 



"Did you want something?" 



Mark looks away and glances around the rest of the room, scoots his weight up the chair, then looks 
back at me. 

"What are you talking about?" he asks. 

"You stuck your foot out when I passed. And you bumped into me outside. I thought you might have 
wanted something." 

"What's going on?" Mrs. Burton asks behind me. I look over my shoulder at her. 
"Nothing," I say. I turn back to Mark. "Well?" 

His hands tighten around the desk but he remains silent. Our eyes stay locked until he sighs and looks 
away. 

"That's what I thought," I say down at him, and continue walking. The other students aren't sure how to 
respond and most of them are still staring when I take my seat between a redheaded girl with freckles 
and an overweight guy who looks at me with his mouth agape. 

Mrs. Burton stands at the head of the class. She seems a little flustered, but then shrugs it off and 
describes why there are rings around Saturn, and how they're made mostly of ice particles and dust. 
After a while I tune her out and look at the other students. A whole new group of people that I'll yet 
again try to keep at a distance. It's always a fine line, having just enough interaction with them to remain 
mysterious without becoming strange and thus sticking out. I've already done a horrible job of that 
today. 

I take a deep breath and slowly exhale. I still have butterflies in my stomach, still the nagging shake in 
my 

leg. My hands feel warmer. Mark James sits three tables in front of me. He turns once and looks at me, 
then whispers something into Sarah's ear. She turns ar ound. She seems cool, but the fact that she used 
to 

date him and is sitting with him makes me wonder. She gives me a warm smile. I want to smile back but 
I'm frozen. Mark again tries to whisper to her but she shakes her head and pushes him away. My hearing 
is much better than human hearing if I focus it, but I'm so flustered by her smile that I don't. I wish I 
could have heard what was said. 

I open and close my hands. My palms are sweaty and beginning to burn. Another deep breath. My 
vision is blurring. Five minutes pass, then ten. Mrs. Burton is still talking but I don't hear what she is 
saying. I squeeze my fists shut, then reopen them. When I do my breath catches in my throat. A slight 
glow is coming from my right palm. I look down at it, dumbfounded, amazed. After a few seconds the 



glow begins to brighten. 



I close my fists. My initial fear is that something else has happened to one of the others. But what could 
happen? We can't be killed out of order. That is the way the charm works. But does that mean that 
some other harm can't befall them? Has somebody's right hand been cut off? I have no way of knowing. 
But if something had happened, I would have felt it in the scars on my ankles. And only then does it 
dawn 

on me. My first Legacy must be forming. 

I pull my phone out of my bag, and send Henri a text that saysCMEE , though I meant to typeCOME . 
I'm too dizzy to send anything else. I close my fists and place them in my lap. They're burning and 
shaking. I open my hands. My left palm is bright red, my right is still glowing. I glance at the clock on the 
wall and see that class is almost over. If I can get out of here I can find an empty room and call Henri and 
ask him what's going on. I start counting the seconds: sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight. It feels like something 
is 

going to explode in my hands. I focus on the counting. Forty, thirty-nine. They're tingling now, as though 
little needles are being stuck into my palms. Twenty-eight, twenty-seven. I open my eyes and stare 
ahead, focusing on Sarah with the hope that looking at her will distract me. Fifteen, fourteen. Seeing her 
makes it worse. The needles feel like nails now. Nails that have been put in a furnace and heated until 
they're glowing. Eight, seven. 

The bell rings and in an instant I'm up and out of the room, rushing past the other students. I'm feeling 
dizzy, unsteady on my feet. I continue down the hall and have no idea where to go. I can feel someone 
following me. I pull my schedule from my back pocket and check my locker number. As luck would 
have it, my locker is just to my right. I stop at it and lean my head against the metal door. I shake my 
head, realizing that in my rush to get out of the classroom I left behind my bag with my phone inside of 
it. 

And then someone pushes me. 
"What's up, tough guy?" 

I stumble a few steps, look back. Mark is standing there, smiling at me. 
"Something wrong?" he asks. 
"No," I reply. 

My head is spinning. I feel like I'm going to pass out. And my hands are on fire. Whatever is happening 
couldn't be happening at a worse time. He pushes me again. 

"Not so tough without any teachers around, are you?" 



I'm too unbalanced to stay standing, and I trip over my own feet and fall to the ground. Sarah steps in 
front of Mark. 

"Leave him alone," she says. 

"This has nothing to do with you," he says. 

"Right. You see a new kid talking to me and you try immediately to start a fight with him. This is just one 
example of why we aren't together anymore." 

I start to stand up. Sarah reaches down to help me, and as soon as she touches me, the pain in my hands 
flares up and it feels like lightning strikes through my head. I turn around and start rushing away, in the 
opposite direction from the astronomy class. I know that everyone will think I'm a coward for running, 
but I feel like I'm about to pass out. I'll thank Sarah, and deal with Mark, later. Right now I just need to 
find a room with a lock on the door. 

I get to the end of the hall, which intersects with the school's main entrance. I think back to Mr. Harris's 
orientation, which included where the various rooms were located in the school. If I remember 
correctly, 

the auditorium, band rooms, and ar t rooms are at the end of this hall. I run towards them as fast as I can 
in my current state. Behind me I can hear Mark yelling to me, and Sarah yelling at him. I open the first 
door I find, and shut it behind me. Thankfully there is a lock, which I click into place. 

I'm in a dark room. Strips of negatives hang on drying lines. I collapse onto the floor. My head spins and 
my hands are burning. Since first seeing the light, I have kept my hands clenched into fists. I look down 
at 

them now and see my right hand is still glowing, pulsating. I start to panic. 

I sit on the floor, sweat stinging my eyes. Both hands are in terrible pain. I knew to expect my Legacies, 
but I had no idea it would include this. I open my hands and my right palm is shining brightly, the light 
beginning to concentrate. My left is dimly flickering, the burning sensation almost unbearable. I wish 
Henri 

was here. I hope he's on his way. 

I close my eyes and fold my arms across my body. I rock back and forth on the floor, everything inside 
of me in pain. I don't know how much time is passing. One minute? Ten minutes? The bell rings, 
signaling 

the start of the next period. I can hear people talking outside the door. The door shakes a couple times, 
but it's locked and nobody will be able to get in. I just keep rocking, eyes closed tightly. More knocks 
begin to fall on the door. Muffled voices that I can't understand. I open my eyes and can see that the 
glow from my hands has lit up the entire room. I squeeze my hands into fists to try and stop the light but 
it 



streams out between my fingers. Then the door really starts shaking. What will they think of the light in 
my hands? There is no hiding it. How will I explain it? 

"John? Open the doorâ€”it's me," a voice says. 

Relief floods through me. Henri's v oice, the only voice in the whole world that I want to hear. 



CHAPTER FIVE 

I CRAWL TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCK IT. IT SWINGSopen. Henri is covered in dirt, wearing 
gardening clothes as though he had been working outside on the house. I'm so happy to see him that I 
have the urge to jump up and wrap my arms around him, and I try to, but I'm too dizzy and I fall back 
onto the floor. 

"Is everything okay in there?" asks Mr. Harris, who is standing behind Henri. 
"Everything is fine. Just give us a minute, please," Henri says back. 
"Do I need to call an ambulance?" 
"No!" 

The door shuts. Henri looks down at my hands. The light in the right one is shining brightly, though the 
left dimly flickers as though trying to gain confidence in itself. Henri smiles widely, his face shining like a 
beacon. 

"Ahh, thank Lorien," he sighs, then pulls a pair of leather gardening gloves from his back pocket. "What 
dumb luck that I've been working in the yard. Put these on. " 

I do and they completely hide the light. Mr. Harris opens the door and sticks his head through. "Mr. 
Smith? Is ev erything okay?" 

"Yes, everything is fine. Just give us thirty seconds," Henri says, then looks back to me. "Your principal 
meddles." 

I take a deep breath and exhale. "I understand what is happening, but why this?" 



"Your first Legacy. " 



"I know that, but why the lights?" 

"We'll talk about it in the truck. Can you walk?" 

"I think so." 

He helps me up. I am unsteady, still shaking. I grab hold of his forearm for support. 

"I have to get my bag before we leave," I say. 

"Where is it?" 

"I left it in the classroom." 

"What number?" 

"Seventeen." 

"Let's get you to the truck and I'll go get it." 

I drape my right arm over his shoulders. He supports my weight by putting his left arm around my waist. 
Even though the second bell has rung I can still hear people in the hall. 

"You need to walk as straight and as normal as you can." 

I take a deep breath. I try to gather any bit of strength I might have on reserve to tackle the long walk 
out of the school. 

"Let's do this," I say. 

I wipe the sweat from my forehead and follow Henri out of the darkroom. Mr. Harris is still in the 
hallway. 

"Just a bad case of asthma," Henri tells him, and walks past. 

A crowd of twenty or so people are still in the hallway, and most of them are wearing cameras around 
their necks, waiting to get into the darkroom for photography class. Thankfully Sarah isn't among them. I 
walk as steadily as I can, one foot in front of the other. The school's exit is a hundred feet away. That is a 
lot of steps. People are whispering. 



"What a freak." 



"Does he even go to school here?" 



"I hope so, he's cute." 

"What do you think he was doing in the darkroom to make his face so red?" I hear, and everyone 
laughs. Just like we can focus our hearing, we can close it off, which helps when you're trying to 
concentrate amidst noise and confusion. So I shut out the noise and follow closely behind Henri. Each 
step feels like ten, but finally we reach the door. Henri holds it open for me and I try to walk on my own 
to his truck, which is parked up front. For the last twenty steps I drape my arm around his shoulders 
again. He opens the truck door and I scoot in. 

"You said seventeen?" 

"Yes." 

"You should have kept it with you. It's the little mistakes that lead to big mistakes. We can't make any." 
"I know. I'm sorry." 

He shuts the door and walks back into the building. I hunch over in the seat and try to slow my 
breathing. I can still feel the sweat on my forehead. I sit up and flip down the sun visor so I can look into 
the mirror. My face is redder than I thought, my eyes a little watery. But through the pain and 
exhaustion, 

I smile. Finally , I think. After years of waiting, after years of my only defense against the Mogadorians 
being intellect and stealth, my first Legacy has arrived. Henri comes out of the school carrying my bag. 
He walks around the truck, opens the door, tosses my bag on the seat. 

"Thank you," I say. 

"No problem. " 

When we're out of the lot I remove the gloves and take a closer look at my hands. The light in my right 
hand is beginning to concentrate itself into a beam like a flashlight, only brighter. The burning is 
beginning 

to lessen. My left hand still flickers dimly. 

"You should keep those on until we're home," Henri says. 

I put the gloves back on and look over at him. He is smiling proudly. 

"Been a shit long wait," he says. 



"Huh?" I ask. 



He looks over. "A shit long wait," he says again. "For your Legacies." 

I laugh. Of all the things Henri has learned to master while on Earth, profanity is not one of them. 
"Adamn long wait," I correct him. 
"Yeah, that's what I said." 
He turns down our road. 

"So, what next? Does this mean I'll be able to shoot lasers from my hands or what?" 
He grins. "It's nice to think so, but no." 

"Well, what am I going to do with light? When I'm getting chased am I going to turn and flash it in their 
eyes? Like that's supposed to make them cower from me or something?" 

"Patience," he says. "You aren't supposed to understand it yet. Let's just get home." 

And then I remember something that nearly makes me jump out of my seat. 

"Does this mean we'll finally open the Chest?" 
He nods and smiles. "Very soon." 

"Hell, yes!" I say. The intricately carved wooden Chest has haunted me my entire life. It's a 
brittle-looking box with the Loric symbol on its side that Henri has remained completely secretive about. 
He's never told me what's in it, and it's impossible to open, and I know, because I've tried more times 
than I can count, never with any luck. It's held shut with a padlock with no discernible slot for a key. 

When we get home I can tell that Henri has been working. The three chairs from the front porch have 
been cleared away and all the windows are open. Inside, the sheets over the furniture have been 
removed, some of the surfaces wiped clean. I set my bag atop the table in the living room and open it. A 
wave of frustration passes over me. 

"The son of a bitch," I say. 



"What?" 



"My phone is missing." 



"Where is it?" 

"I had a slight disagreement this morning with a kid named Mark James. He probably took it." 

"John, you were in school for an hour and a half. How in the hell did you have a disagreement already? 
You know better." 

"It's high school. I'm the new kid. It's easy." 

Henri removes his phone from his pocket and dials my number. Then he snaps his phone shut. 

"It's turned off," he says. 

"Ofcourseitis." 

He stares at me. "What happened?" he asks in that voice I recognize, the voice he uses when pondering 
another move. 

"Nothing. Just a stupid argument. I probably dropped it on the floor when I put it into my bag," I say, 
even though I know I didn't. "I wasn't in the best frame of mind. It's probably waiting for me in lost and 
found." 

He looks around the house and sighs. "Did anyone see your hands?" 

I look at him. His eyes are red, even more bloodshot than they were when he dropped me off. His hair 
is tousled and he has a slumped look as though he may collapse in exhaustion at any moment. He last 
slept in Florida, two days ago. I'm not sure how he is even still standing. 

"Nobody did." 

"You were in school for an hour and a half. Your first Legacy developed, you were nearly in a fight, and 
you left your bag in a classroom. That's not exactly blending in." 

"It was nothing. Certainly not a big enough deal to move to Idaho, or Kansas, or wherever the hell our 
next place is going to be." 

Henri narrows his eyes, pondering what he just witnessed and trying to decide whether it's enough to 
justify leaving. 

"Now is not the time to be careless," he says. 



"There are arguments in every single school every single day. I promise you, they aren't going to track us 
because some bully messed with the new kid." 

"The new kid's hands don't light up in every school." 

I sigh. "Henri, you look like you're about to die. Take a nap. We can decide after you've had some 
sleep." 

"We have a lot to talk about." 

"I've never seen you this tired before. Sleep a few hours. We'll talk after." 
He nods. "A nap would probably do me some good." 

Henri goes into his bedroom and closes the door. I walk outside, pace around the yard for a bit. The sun 
is behind the trees with a cool wind blowing. The gloves are still on my hands. I take them off and tuck 
them into my back pocket. My hands are the same as before. Truth be told, only half of me is thrilled 
that 

my first Legacy has finally arrived after so many years of impatiently waiting. The other half of me is 
crushed. Our constant moving has worn me down, and now it'll be impossible to blend in or to stay in 
one place for any period of time. It'll be impossible to make friends or feel like I fit in. I'm sick of the 
fake names and the lies. I'm sick of always looking over my shoulder to see if I'm being followed. 

I reach down and feel the three scars on my right ankle. Three circles that represent the three dead. We 
are bound to each other by more than mere race. As I feel the scars I try to imagine who they were, 
whether they were boys or girls, where they were living, how old they were when they died. I try to 
remember the other kids on the ship with me and give each of them numbers. I think about what it 
would 

be like to meet them, hang out with them. What it might have been like if we were still on Lorien. What 
it 

might be like if the fate of our entire race wasn't dependent on the survival of so few of us. What it 
might 

be like if we weren't all facing death at the hands of our enemies. 

It's terrifying to know that I'm next. But we've stayed ahead of them by moving, running. Even though 
I'm sick of the running I know it's the only reason we're still alive. If we stop, they will find us. And now 
that I'm next in line, they have undoubtedly stepped up the search. Surely they must know we are 
growing stronger, coming into our Legacies. 

And then there is the other ankle and the scar to be found there, formed when the Loric charm was cast 



in those precious moments before leaving Lorien. It's the brand that binds us all together. 



CHAPTER SIX 

I WALK INSIDE AND LIE ON THE BARE MATTRESSin my room. The morning has worn me out 
and I let my eyes close. When I reopen them the sun is lifted over the tops of the trees. I walk out of the 
room. Henri is at the kitchen table with his laptop open and I know he's been scanning the news, as he 
always does, searching for information or stories that might tell us where the others are. 

"Did you sleep?" I ask. 

"Not much. We have internet now and I haven't checked the news since Florida. It was gnawing at me. " 
"Anything to report?" I ask. 

He shrugs. "A fourteen-year-old in Africa fell from a fourth-story window and walked away without a 
scratch. There is a fifteen-year-old in Bangladesh claiming to be the Messiah." 

I laugh. "I know the fifteen-year-old isn't us. Any chance of the other?" 

"Nah. Surviving a four-story drop is no great feat, and besides, if it was one of us they wouldn't have 
been that careless in the first place," he says, and winks. 

I smile and sit across from him. He closes his computer and places his hands on the table. His watch 
reads 1 1:36. We've been in Ohio for slightly over half a day and already this much has happened. I hold 
my palms up. They've dimmed since the last time I looked. 

"Do you know what you hav e?" he asks. 

"Lights in my hands." 

He chuckles. "It's called Lumen. You'll be able to control the light in time." 

"I sure hope so, because our cover is blown if they don't turn off soon. I still don't see what the point is, 
though." 

"There's more to Lumen than mere lights. I promise you." 



"What's the rest?" 



He walks into his bedroom and returns with a lighter in his hand. 

"Do you remember much of your grandparents?" he asks. Our grandparents are the ones who raise us. 
We see little of our parents until we reach the age of twenty-five, when we have children of our own. 
The 

life expectancy for the Loric is around two hundred years, much longer than that of humans, and when 
children are born, between the parents' ages of twenty-five and thirty-five, the elders are the ones who 
raise them while the parents continue honing their Legacies. 

"A little. Why?" 

"Because your grandfather had the same gift." 
"I don't remember his hands ever glowing," I say. 

Henri shrugs. "He might never have had reason to use it." 
"Wonderful," I say. "Sounds like a great gift to have, one I'll never use." 
He shakes his head. "Give me your hand." 

I give him the right one and he flicks the lighter on, then moves it to touch the tip of my finger with the 
flame. I jerk my hand away. 

"What are you doing?" 

"Trust me," he says. 

I give my hand back to him. He takes hold of it and flicks the lighter on again. He looks into my eyes. 
Then he smiles. I look down and see that he is holding the flame over the tip of my middle finger. I don't 
feel a thing. Instinct causes me to jerk my hand free anyway. I rub my finger. It feels no different than it 
did before. 

"Did you feel that?" he asks. 
"No." 

"Give it back," he says. "And tell me when you do feel something." 



He starts at my fingertip again, then mov es the flame very slowly up the back of my hand. There is a 



slight tickle where the flame touches the skin, nothing more. Only when the fire reaches my wrist do I 
begin to sense the burn. I pull my arm free. 

"Ouch." 

"Lumen," he says. "You're going to become resistant to fire and heat. Your hands come naturally, but 
we'll have to train the rest of your body." 

A smile spreads across my face. "Resistant to fire and heat," I say. "So I'll nev er be burned again?" 
"Eventually, yes." 
"That's awesome!" 

"Not such a bad Legacy after all, huh?" 

"Not bad at all," I agree. "Now what about these lights? Are they ever going to turn off?" 

"They will. Probably after a good night's sleep, when your mind forgets they're on," he says. "But you'll 
have to be careful not to get worked up for a while. An emotional imbalance will cause them to come 
right back on again, if you get overly nervous, or angry, or sad." 

"For how long?" 

"Until you learn to control them." He closes his eyes and rubs his face with his hands. "Anyway, I'm 
going to try to sleep again. We'll talk about your training in a few hours." 

After he leaves I stay at the kitchen table, opening and closing my hands, taking deep breaths and trying 
to calm everything inside of me so the lights will dim. Of course it doesn't work. 

Everything in the house is still a mess aside from the few things Henri did while I was at school. I can tell 
that he is leaning towards leaving, but not to the point that he couldn't be persuaded to stay. Maybe if 
he 

wakes and finds the house clean and in order it'll tip him in the right direction. 

I start with my room. I dust, wash the windows, sweep the floor. When everything is clean I throw 
sheets, pillows, and blankets on the bed, then hang and fold my clothes. The dresser is old and rickety, 
but I fill it and then place the few books I own on top of it. And just like that, a cl ean room, everything I 
own put away and in order. 

I move to the kitchen, putting away dishes and wiping down the counters. It gives me something to do 
and takes my mind off of my hands, even though while cleaning I think about Mark James. For the first 



time in my life I stood up to somebody. I've always wanted to but never did because I wanted to heed 
Henri's advice to keep a low profile. I've always tried to delay another move for as long as I could. But 
today was different. There was something very satisfying about being pushed by somebody and 
responding by pushing back. And then there's the issue of my phone, which was stolen. Sure, we could 
easily get a new one, but where is the justice in that? 



CHAPTER SEVEN 

I WAKE BEFORE THE ALARM. THE HOUSE IS COOLand silent. I lift my hands from under the 
covers. They are normal, no lights, no glow. I lumber out of bed and into the living room. Henri is at the 
kitchen table reading the local paper and drinking coffee. 

"Good morning," he says. "How do you feel?" 

"Like a million bucks," I say. 

I pour myself a bowl of cereal and sit across from him. 
"What are you going to do today?" I ask. 

"Errands mostly. We're getting low on money. I'm thinking of putting in a transfer at the bank." 

Lorien is (or was, depending on how you look at it) a planet rich with natural resources. Some of those 
resources were precious gems and metals. When we left, each C pan was giv en a sack full of 
diamonds, 

emeralds and rubies to sell when we arrived on Earth. Henri did, and then deposited the money into an 
overseas bank account. I don't know how much there is and I never ask. But I know it's enough to last 
us ten lifetimes, if not more. Henri makes withdrawals from it once a year, give or take. 

"I don't know, though," he continues. "I don't want to stray too far in case something else happens 
today." 

Not wanting to make a big deal of yesterday, I wave the notion away. "I'll be fine. Go get paid." 

I look out the window. Dawn is breaking, casting a pale light over everything. The truck is covered with 
dew. It's been a while since we've been through a winter. I don't even own a jacket and have outgrown 
most of my sweaters. 

"It looks cold out," I say. "Maybe we can go clothes shopping soon." 



He nods. "I was thinking about that last night, which is why I need to go to the bank." 
"Then go," I say. "Nothing is going to happen today." 

I finish the bowl of cereal, drop the dirty dish into the sink, and jump into the shower. Ten minutes later 
I'm dressed in a pair of jeans and a black thermal shirt, the sleeves pulled to my elbows. I look in the 
mirror, and down at my hands. I feel calm. I need to stay that way. 

On the way to school Henri hands me a pair of gloves. 

"Make sure you keep these with you at all times. You never know." 

I tuck them into my back pocket. 

"I shouldn't need them. I feel pretty good." 

At the school, buses are lined up in front. Henri pulls up to the side of the building. 

"I don't like you not having a phone," he says. "Any number of things could go wrong." 

"Don't worry. I'll have it back soon." 

He sighs and shakes his head. "Don't do anything stupid. I'll be right here at the end of the day." 
"I won't," I say, and get out of the truck. He pulls away. 

Inside, the halls are bustling with activity, students loitering at lockers, talking, laughing. A few look at 
me 

and whisper. I don't know whether it's because of the confrontation or because of the darkroom. It's 
likely that they are whispering about both. It is a small school, and in small schools there is little that 
isn't 

readily known by ev eryone else. 

When I reach the main entrance, I turn right and find my locker. It's empty. I have fifteen minutes before 
sophomore composition begins. I walk by the classroom just to make sure I know where it is and then 
head to the office. The secretary smiles when I enter. 

"Hi," I say. "I lost my phone yesterday and I was wondering if anyone turned it in to lost and found?" 
She shakes her head. "No, I'm afraid no phone's been turned in." 



"Thank you," I say. 



Out in the hallway I don't see Mark anywhere. I pick a direction and begin walking. People still stare 
and whisper, but that doesn't bother me. I see him fifty feet ahead of me. All at once the thrill of 
adrenaline kicks in. I look down at my hands. They're normal. I'm worried about them turning on, and 
that worry might just be the thing that does it. 

Mark's leaning against a locker with his arms crossed, in the middle of a group, five guys and two girls, 
all of them talking and laughing. Sarah is sitting on a windowsill about fifteen feet away. She looks 
radiant 

again today with her blond hair pulled into a ponytail, wearing a skirt and a gray sweater. She's reading a 
book, but looks up as I walk towards them. 

I stop just outside of the group, stare at Mark, and wait. He notices me after about five seconds. 
"What do you want?" he asks. 
"You know what I want." 

Our eyes stay locked. The crowd around us swells to ten people, then twenty. Sarah stands and walks 
to the edge of the crowd. Mark is wearing his letterman jacket, and his black hair is carefully styled to 
look like he rolled straight out of bed and into his clothes. 

He pushes away from the locker and walks towards me. When he is inches away he stops. Our chests 
nearly touch and the spicy scent of his cologne fills my nostrils. He is probably six one, a couple inches 
taller than I am. We have the same build. Little does he know that what is inside of me is not what is 
inside of him. I am quicker than he is and far stronger. The thought brings a confident grin to my face. 

"You think you can stay in school a little longer today? Or are you going to run off again like a little 
bitch?" 

Snickers spread through the crowd. 
"I guess we'll see, won't we?" 

"Yeah, I guess we will," he says, and moves even closer. 
"I want my phone back," I say. 
"I don't have your phone." 

I shake my head at him. "There are two people who saw you take it," I lie. 



By the way his brows crinkle I know I have guessed correctly. 
"Yeah, and what if it was me? What are you going to do?" 

There are probably thirty people around us now. I have no doubt that the entire school will know what 
has happened within ten minutes of the start of first period. 

"You've been warned," I say. "You have till the end of the day." 

I turn and leave. 

"Or what?" he yells behind me. I don't acknowledge it. Let him dwell on the answer. My fists have been 
clenched and I realize I had mistaken adrenaline for nerves. Why was I so nervous? The unpredictability? 
The fact that this is the first time I've confronted somebody? The possibility of my hands glowing? 

Probably all three. 

I go to the bathroom, enter an empty stall, and latch the door behind me. I open my hands. A slight glow 
in the right one. I close my eyes and sigh, focus on breathing slowly. A minute later the glow is still there. 
I shake my head. I didn't think the Legacy would be that sensitive. I stay in the stall. A thin layer of sweat 
covers my forehead; both of my hands are warm, but thankfully the left is still normal. People filter in 
and 

out of the bathroom and I stay in the stall, waiting. The light stays on. Finally the first-period bell rings 
and 

the bathroom is empty. 

I shake my head in disgust and accept the inevitable. I don't have my phone and Henri is on his way to 
the bank. I'm alone with my own stupidity and I have no one to blame but myself. I pull the gloves from 
my back pocket and slip them on. Leather gardening gloves. I couldn't look more foolish if I were 
wearing clown shoes with yellow pants. So much for blending in. I realize I have to stop with Mark. He 
wins. He can keep my phone; Henri and I will get a new one tonight. 

I leave the bathroom and walk the empty hallway to my classroom. Everybody stares at me when I 
enter, then at the gloves. There is no point trying to hide them. I look like a fool. I am an alien, I have 
extraordinary powers, with more to come, and I can do things that no human would dream of, but I still 
look like a fool. 



I sit in the center of the room. Nobody says anything to me and I'm too flustered to hear what the 



teacher says. When the bell rings I gather my things, drop them into my bag, and pull the straps over my 
shoulder. I'm still wearing the gloves. When I exit the room I lift the cuff of the right one and peek at my 
palm. It's still glowing. 

I walk the hall at a steady pace. Slow breathing. I try to clear my mind but it isn't working. When I enter 
the classroom Mark is sitting in the same spot as the day before, Sarah beside him. He sneers at me. 
Trying to act cool, he doesn't notice the gloves. 

"What's up, runner? I heard the cross-country team is looking for new members." 

"Don't be such a dick," Sarah says to him. I look at her as I pass, into her blue eyes that make me feel 
shy and self-conscious, that make my cheeks warm. The seat I sat in the day before is occupied, so I 
head to the very back. The class fills and the kid from yesterday, the one who warned me about Mark, 
sits next to me. He's wearing another black T-shirt with a NASA logo in the center, army pants, and a 
pair of Nike tennis shoes. He has disheveled, sandy blond hair, and his hazel eyes are magnified by his 
glasses. He pulls out a notepad filled with diagrams of constellations and planets. He looks at me and 
doesn't try to hide the fact that he is staring. 

"How goes it?" I ask. 

He shrugs. "Why are you wearing gloves?" 

I open my mouth to answer, but Mrs. Burton starts the class. During most of it the guy beside me draws 
pictures that seem to be his interpretation of what Martians look like. Small bodies; big heads, hands, 
and 

eyes. The same stereotypical representations that are usually shown in movies. At the bottom of every 
drawing he writes his name in small letters: SAM GOODE . He notices me watching, and I look away. 

As Mrs. Burton lectures on Saturn's sixty-one moons, I look at the back of Mark's head. He's hunched 
over his desk, writing. Then he sits up and passes a note to Sarah. She flicks it back at him without 
reading it. It makes me smile. Mrs. Burton turns off the lights and starts a video. The rotating planets 
being projected on the screen at the front of the class make me think of Lorien. It is one of the eighteen 
life-sustaining planets in the universe. Earth is another. Mogadore, unfortunately, is another. 

Lorien. I close my eyes and allow myself to remember. An old planet, a hundred times older than Earth. 
Every problem that Earth now has â€”pollution, overpopulation, global warming, food shortagesâ€” Lorien 
also had. At one point, twenty-five thousand years ago, the planet began to die. This was long before 
the 

ability to travel through the universe, and the people of Lorien had to do something in order to survive. 
Slowly but surely they made a commitment to ensure that the planet would forever remain self- 
sustaining 

by changing their way of life, doing away with everything harmfulâ€” guns and bombs, poisonous 



chemicals, pollutants â€”and over time the damage began to reverse itself. With the benefit of evolution, 
over thousands of years, certain citizensâ€”the Gardeâ€”developed powers in order to protect the planet, 
and to help it. It was as though Lorien rewarded my ancestors for their foresight, for their respect. 

Mrs. Burton flicks the lights on. I open my eyes and look at the clock. Class is almost over. I feel calm 
again, and had completely forgotten about my hands. I take a deep breath and flip open the cuff of the 
right glove. The light is off! I smile and remove both gloves. Back to normal. I have six periods left in the 
day. I have to remain at peace through all of them. 



The first half of the day passes without incident. I remain calm, and likewise have no further encounters 
with Mark. At lunch I fill my tray with the basics, then find an empty table at the back of the room. 
When 

I'm halfway through a slice of pizza, Sam Goode, the kid from astronomy class, sits across from me. 
"Are you really fighting Mark after school?" he asks. 
I shake my head. "No." 
"That's what people are saying." 
"They're wrong." 

He shrugs, keeps eating. A minute later he asks, "Where'd your gloves go?" 
"I took them off. My hands aren't cold anymore." 

He opens his mouth to respond but a giant meatball that I'm sure is aimed for me comes out of nowhere 
and hits him in the back of the head. His hair and shoulders are covered with bits of meat and spaghetti 
sauce. Some of it has splattered onto me. While I start cleaning myself off a second meatball flies 
through 

the air and hits me square on the cheek. Ooh s filter throughout the cafeteria. 

I stand and wipe the side of my face with a napkin, anger coursing through me. In that instant I don't 
care about my hands. They can shine as brightly as the sun, and Henri and I can leave this afternoon if 
that's what it comes to. But there isn't a chance in hell I'm letting this slide. It was over after this 
morning... but not now. 

"Don't," Sam says. "If you fight then they'll nev er leave you alone." 

I start walking. A hush falls over the cafeteria. A hundred sets of eyes focus on me. My face twists into a 



scowl. Seven people are sitting at Mark James's table, all guys. All seven of them stand as I approach. 

"You got a problem?" one of them asks me. He is big, built like an offensive lineman. Patches of reddish 
hair grow on his cheeks and chin as though he's trying to grow a beard. It makes his face look dirty. Like 
the rest of them he's wearing a letterman jacket. He crosses his arms and stands in my way. 

"This doesn't concern you," I say. 

"You'll have to go through me to get to him." 

"I will if you don't get out of my way. " 

"I don't think you can," he says. 

I bring my knee straight up into his crotch. His breath catches in his throat, and he doubles over. The 
whole lunchroom gasps. 

"I warned you," I say, and I step over him and walk straight for Mark. Just as I reach him I'm grabbed 
from behind. I turn with my hands clenched into fists, ready to swing, but at the last second I realize it's 
the lunchroom attendant. 

"That'll be enough, boys." 

"Look what he just did to Kevin, Mr. Johnson," Mark says. Kevin is still on the ground holding himself. 
His face is beet red. "Send him to the principal!" 

"Shut up, James. All four of you are going. Don't think I didn't see you throw those meatballs," he says, 
and looks at Kevin still on the floor. "Get up." 

Sam appears from nowhere. He has tried to wipe the mess from his hair and shoulders. The big pieces 
are gone, but the sauce has only smeared. I'm not sure why he's here. I look down at my hands, ready 
to flee at the first hint of light, but to my surprise they're off. Was it because of the urgency of the 
situation, allowing me to approach without preemptive nerves? I don't know. 

Kevin stands and looks at me. He is shaky, still having trouble breathing. He grips the shoulder of the 
guy beside him for support. 

"You'll get yours," he says. 

"I doubt it," I say. I'm still scowling, still covered in food. To hell with wiping it away. 

The four of us walk to the principal's office. Mr. Harris is sitting behind his desk eating a microwavable 



lunch, a napkin tucked into the neck of his shirt. 

"Sorry to interrupt. We just had a slight disruption during lunch. I'm sure these boys will be happy to 
explain," the lunchroom attendant says. 

Mr. Harris sighs, pulls the napkin from his shirt, and throws it in the trash. He pushes his lunch to the 
side 

of his desk with the back of his hand. 
"Thank you, Mr. Johnson." 

Mr. Johnson leaves, closing the office door behind him, and the four of us sit. 
"So who wants to start?" the principal asks, irritation in his voice. 

I stay silent. The muscles in Mr. Harris's jaw are flexed. I look down at my hands. Still off. I place them 
palms down on my jeans just in case. After ten seconds of silence, Mark starts. "Somebody hit him with 
a meatball. He thinks it was me, so he kneed Kevin in the balls." 

"Watch your language," Mr. Harris says, and then turns to Kevin. "You okay?" 

Kevin, whose face is still red, nods. 

"So who threw the meatball?" Mr. Harris asks me. 

I say nothing, still seething, irritated at the whole scene. I take a deep breath to try to calm myself. 

"I don't know," I say. My anger has reached new levels. I don't want to hav e to deal with Mark through 
Mr. Harris, and would rather take care of the situation myself, away from the principal's office. 

Sam looks at me in surprise. Mr. Harris throws his hands up in frustration. "Well then, why in the hell are 
you boys here?" 

"That's a good question," says Mark. "We were simply eating our lunch." 
Sam speaks. "Mark threw it. I saw him and so did Mr. Johnson." 

I look over at Sam. I know he didn't see it because his back was turned the first time, and the second 

time he was busy cleaning himself off. But I'm impressed at him saying so, for his taking my side knowing 

it will put him in danger with Mark and his friends. Mark scowls at him. 



"Come on, Mr. Harris," Mark pleads. "I have the interview with theGazette tomorrow, and the game on 
Friday. I don't have time to worry about crap like this. I'm being accused of something I didn't do. It's 
hard to stay focused with this shit going on. " 

"Watch your mouth!" Mr. Harris yells. 
"It's true." 

"I believe you," the principal says, and sighs very heav ily. He looks at Kevin, who's still struggling to 
catch his breath. "Do you need to go to the nurse?" 

"I'll be fine," Kevin says. 

Mr. Harris nods. "You two forget about the lunchroom incident, and Mark, get your mind straight. 
We've been trying to get this article for a while now. They might even put us on the front page. Imagine 
that, the front page of theGazette ," he says, and smiles. 

"Thank you," Mark says. "I'm excited about it." 

"Good. Now, you two can leave." 



They go, and Mr. Harris gives a hard look at Sam. Sam holds his gaze. 
"Tell me, Sam. And I want the truth. Did you see Mark throw the meatball?" 
Sam's eyes narrow. He doesn't look away. 
"Yes." 

The principal shakes his head. "I don't believe you, Sam. And because of that, here is what we are 
going to do." He looks at me. "So a meatball was thrown--" 

"Two," Sam interjects. 

"What?!" Mr. Harris asks, again glowering at Sam. 
"There were two meatballs thrown, not one." 



Mr. Harris slams his fist on the desk. "Who cares how many there were! John, you assaulted Kevin. An 
eye for an eye. We'll let it go at that. Do you understand me?" 



His face is red and I know it's pointless to argue. 
"Yep," I say. 

"I don't want to see you two in here again," he says. "You're both dismissed." 
We leave his office. 

"Why didn't you tell him about your phone?" Sam asks. 

"Because he doesn't care. He just wanted to go back to his lunch," I say. "And be careful," I tell him. 
"You'll be on Mark's radar now." 



I have home economics after lunchâ€”not because I necessarily care about cooking, but because it was 
either that or choir. And while I have many strengths and powers that are considered exceptional on 
Earth, singing is not one of them. So I walk into home ec and take a seat. It is a small room, and just 
before the bell rings Sarah walks in and sits beside me. 

"Hi," she says. 

"Hi." 

Blood rushes to my face and my shoulders stiffen. I grab a pencil and begin to twirl it in my right hand 
while my left bends back the corners of my notepad. My heart is pounding. Please don't let my hands be 
glowing. I peek at my palm and breathe a sigh of relief that it's still normal. Stay calm, I think. She's just a 

girl- 
Sarah is looking at me. Everything inside of me feels as though it is tur ning to mush. She may be the 
most 

beautiful girl I have ever seen. 

"I'm sorry Mark is being a jerk to you," she says. 

I shrug. "It's not your fault." 

"You guys aren't really going to fight, are you?" 

"I don't want to," I say. 

She nods. "He can be a real dick. He always tries to show he's boss." 



"It's a sign of insecurity," I say. 



"He's not insecure. Just a dick." 

Sure he is. But I don't want to argue with Sarah. Besides, she speaks with such certainty that I almost 
doubt myself. 

She looks at the spots of spaghetti sauce that have dried on my shirt, then reaches over and pulls a 
hardened piece from my hair. 

"Thanks," I say. 

She sighs. "I'm sorry that happened." She looks me in the eye. "We're not together, you know?" 
"No?" 

She shakes her head. I'm intrigued that she felt the need to make that clear to me. After ten minutes of 
instruction on how to make pancakesâ€”none of which I actually hearâ€”the teacher, Mrs. Benshoff, pairs 
Sarah and me together. We enter a door at the back of the room that leads to the kitchen, which is 
about 

three times the size of the actual classroom. It contains ten different kitchen units, complete with 
refrigerators, cabinets, sinks, ovens. Sarah walks into one, grabs an apron from a drawer, and puts it on. 

"Will you tie this for me?" she asks. 

I pull too much on the bow and have to tie it again. I can feel the contours of her lower back beneath my 
fingers. When hers is tied I put mine on and start to tie it myself. 

"Here, silly," she says, and then takes the straps and does it for me. 

"Thanks." 

I try cracking the first egg but do it too hard, and none of the egg actually makes it into the bowl. Sarah 
laughs. She places a new egg in my hand and takes my hand in hers and shows me how to crack it on the 
rim of the bowl. She leaves her hand on mine for a second longer than is necessary. She looks at me and 
smiles. 

"Like that." 

She mixes the batter and strands of hair fall into her face while she works. I desperately want to reach 
over and tuck the loose strands behind her ear, but I don't. Mrs. Benshoff comes into our kitchen to 



check our progress. So far so good, which is all thanks to Sarah, since I have no idea what I'm doing. 

"How do you like Ohio so far?" Sarah asks. 

"It's okay. I could hav e used a better first day of school." 

She smiles. "What happened, anyway? I was worried about you." 

"Would you believ e it if I told you I was an alien?" 

"Shut up," she says playfully. "What really happened?" 

I laugh. "I have really bad asthma. For some reason I had an attack yesterday," I say, and feel regret at 
having to lie. I don't want her to see weakness within me, especially weakness that is untrue. 

"Well, I'm glad you feel better." 

We make four pancakes. Sarah stacks all of them onto one plate. She dumps an absurd amount of 
maple syrup over them and hands me a fork. I look at the other students. Most are eating off of two 
plates. I reach over and cut a bite. 

"Not bad," I say while chewing. 

I'm not hungry in the least, but I help her eat all of them. We alternate bites until the plate is empty. I 
have a stomachache when we finish. After, she cleans the dishes and I dry them. When the bell rings, we 
walk out of the room together. 

"You know, you're not so bad for a sophomore," she says, and nudges me. "I don't care what they 
say." 

"Thanks, and you're not so bad yourself for aâ€” whatever you are." 
"I'm a junior." 

We walk in silence for a few steps. 

"You're not really going to fight Mark at the end of the day, are you? 

"I need my phone back. Besides, look at me," I say, and motion to my shirt. 

She shrugs. I stop at my locker. She takes note of the number. 



"Well, you shouldn't," she says. 
"I don't want to." 

She rolls her eyes. "Boys and their fights. Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow." 
"Have a good rest of the day," I say. 

After my ninth-period class, American history, I take slow steps to my locker. I think of just leaving the 
school quietly, without looking for Mark. But then I realize I will forever be labeled a coward. 

I get to my locker and empty my bag of the books I don't need. Then I just stand there and feel the 
nervousness that begins to course through me. My hands are still normal. I think of throwing the gloves 
on as a precaution, but I don't. I take a deep breath and close the locker door. 

"Hi," I hear, the v oice startling me. It's Sarah. She glances behind her, and looks back at me. "I have 
something for you." 

"It's not more pancakes, is it? I still feel like I'm about to burst." 
She laughs nervously. 

"It's not pancakes. But if I give it to you, you have to promise me you won't fight." 
"Okay," I say. 

She looks behind her again and quickly reaches into the front pocket of her bag. She pulls out my phone 
and gives it to me. 

"How did you get this?" 

She shrugs. 

"Does Mark know?" 

"Nope. So are you still going to be a tough guy?" she asks. 
"I guess not." 



"Good." 



"Thank you," I say. I can't believe she went to such lengths to help meâ€” she barely knows me. But I'm 
not complaining. 

"You're welcome," she says, then turns and rushes down the hall. I watch her the whole way, unable to 
stop smiling. When I head out, Mark James and eight of his friends meet me in the lobby. 

"Well, well, well," Mark says. "Actually made it through the day, huh?" 

"Sure did. And look what I found," I say, holding my phone up for him to see. H is jaw drops. I pass by 
him, head down the hall and walk out of the building. 



CHAPTER EIGHT 

HENRI IS PARKED EXACTLY WHERE HE SAID HEwould be. I jump in the truck, still smiling. 

"Good day?" he asks. 

"Not bad. Got my phone back." 

"No fighting?" 

"Nothing major." 

He looks at me suspiciously. "Do I even want to know what that means?" 
"Probably not." 

"Did your hands come on at all?" 
"No," I lie. "How was your day?" 

He follows the driveway around the school. "It was good. I drove an hour and a half to Columbus after 
dropping you off." 

"Why Columbus?" 

"Big banks there. I didn't want to draw suspicion by requesting a transfer for an amount of money larger 
than what is collectively contained within the entire town." 



I nod. "Smart thinking." 

He pulls onto the road. 

"So are you going to tell me her name?" 

"Huh?" I ask. 

"There has to be a reason for that ridiculous smile of yours. The most obvious reason is a girl." 
"How'd you know?" 

"John, my friend, back on Lorien this of C pan was quite the ladies' man." 

"Get out of here," I say. "There is no such thing as a ladies' man on Lorien." 
He nods approvingly. "You've been paying attention." 

The Loric are a monogamous people. When we fall in love, it's for life. Marriage comes around the age 
of twenty-five, give or take, and has nothing to do with law. It's based more on promise and 
commitment 

than anything else. Henri was married for twenty years before he left with me. Ten years hav e passed 
but 

I know he still misses his wife every single day. 
"So who is she?" he asks. 

"Her name is Sarah Hart. She's the daughter of the real-estate agent you got the house from. She's in 
two of my classes. She's a junior." 

He nods. "Pretty?" 

"Absolutely. And smart." 

"Yeah," he draws out slowly. "I've been expecting this for a long time now. Just keep in mind that we 
might have to leave at a moment's notice." 

"I know," I say, and the rest of the trip home is made in silence. 



When I get home, the Loric Chest is sitting on the kitchen table. It's the size of a microwave oven, 
almost perfectly square, a foot and a half by a foot and a half. Excitement shoots through me. I walk up 
to it and grab the lock in my hand. 

"I think I'm more excited about learning how this is unlocked than about what's actually in it," I say. 

"Really? Well, I can show you how it's unlocked and then we can just relock it and forget about what's 
inside." 

I smile at him. "Let's not be rash. Come on. What's inside?" 

"It's your Inheritance." 

"What do you mean, my Inheritance?" 

"It's what's given to each Garde at birth to be used by his or her Keeper when the Garde is coming into 
his or her Legacy." 

I nod with exhilaration. "So what's in it?" 
"Your Inheritance." 

His coy response frustrates me. I pick up the lock and try to force it open as I've always tried doing. Of 
course it doesn't budge. 

"You can't open it without me, and I can't open it without you," Henri says. 
"Well, how do we open it? There isn't a keyhole." 
"By will." 

"Oh, come on, Henri. Quit being secretive." 

He takes the lock from me. "The lock only opens when we're together, and only after your first Legacy 
appears." 

He walks to the front door and sticks his head out, then he closes and locks it. He walks back. "Press 
your palm against the side of the lock," he says, and I do. 

"It's warm," I say. 



"Good. That means you're ready." 



"Now what?" 

He presses his palm against the other side of the lock and interlocks his fingers with mine. A second 
passes. The lock snaps open. 

"Amazing!" I say. 

"It's protected by a Loric charm, just like you are. It can't be broken. You could run over it with a 
steam-roller and it wouldn't even be dented. Only the two of us can open it together. Unless I die; then 
you can open it yourself. " 

"Well," I say, "I hope that doesn't happen." 

I try to lift the top of the box, but Henri reaches over and stops me. 

"Not yet," he says. "There are things in here you aren't ready to see. Go sit on the couch." 

"Henri, come on." 

"Just trust me," he says. 

I shake my head and sit down. He opens the box and removes a rock that is probably six inches long, 
two inches thick. He relocks the box, then brings the rock over to me. It is perfectly smooth and oblong, 
clear on the outside but cloudy in the center. 

"What is it?" I ask. 

"A Loric crystal." 

"What's it for?" 

"Hold it," he says, handing it to me. The second my hands come into contact with it both lights snap on 
in my palms. They are even brighter than the day before. The rock begins to warm. I hold it up to look 
more closely at it. The cloudy mass in the center is swirling, turning in on itself like a wave. I can also feel 
the pendant around my neck heating up. I'm thrilled by all this new dev elopment. My whole life has 
been 

spent impatiently waiting for my powers to arrive. Sure, there were times when I hoped they never 
would, mainly so we could finally settle somewhere and live a normal life; but for now â€”holding a crystal 
that contains what looks like a ball of smoke in its center, and knowing my hands are resistant to heat 
and 



fire, and that more Legacies are on the way that will then be followed by my major power (the power 
that will allow me to fight)â€” well, it's all pretty cool and exciting. I can't wipe the smile from my face. 

"What is happening to it?" 

"It's tied to your Legacy. Your touch activates it. If you weren't developing Lumen, then the crystal itself 
would light up the way your hands are. Instead it's the other way around." 

I stare at the crystal, watching the smoke circle and glow. 

"Shall we start?" Henri asks. 

I nod my head rapidly. "Hell, yes." 



The day has turned cold. The house is silent aside from the occasional gust of wind rattling the windows. 
I lie on my back on top of the wooden coffee table. My hands dangle over the sides. At some point 
Henri will build a fire beneath them both. My breathing is slow and steady, as Henri has instructed. 

"You have to keep your eyes closed," he says. "Just listen to the wind. There might be a slight burning in 
your arms when I drag the crystal up them. Ignore it as best as you can." 

I listen to the wind blow through the trees outside. I can somehow feel them sway and bend. 

Henri begins with my right hand. He presses the crystal against the back of it, then pushes it up my wrist 
and onto my forearm. There is a burn as he has predicted, but not enough of one to make me pull my 
arm free. 

"Let your mind drift, John. Go where you need to go." 

I don't know what he's talking about, but I try to clear my mind and breathe slowly. All at once I feel 
myself drift away. From somewhere I can feel the sun's warmth upon my face, and a wind far warmer 
than what is blowing beyond our walls. When I open my eyes I'm no longer in Ohio. 

I'm above a vast expanse of treetops, nothing but jungle as far as I can see. Blue sky, the sun beating 
down, a sun almost double the size of Earth's. A warm, soft wind blows through my hair. Down below, 
riv ers forge deep ravines that cut through the greenery. I am floating above one of them. Animals of all 
shapes and sizesâ€”some long and slender, some with short arms and stout bodies, some with hair and 
some with dark-colored skin that looks rough to the touchâ€” are drinking from the cool waters at the 
riv er's bank. There is a bend in the horizon line far off in the distance, and I know that I am on Lorien. 
It's a planet ten times smaller than Earth, and it's possible to see the curve of its surface when looking 



from far enough away. 



Somehow I'm able to fly. I rush up and twist in the air, then torpedo down and speed along the river's 
surface. The animals lift their heads and watch with curiosity, but not with fear. Lorien in its prime, 
covered with growth, inhabited by animals. In a way, it looks like what I imagine Earth looked like 
millions of years ago, when the land ruled the lives of its creatures, before humans arrived and started 
ruling the land. Lorien in its prime; I know that it no longer looks like this today. I must be living a 
memory. Surely it isn't my own? 

And then the day skips ahead to darkness. Off in the distance a great display of fireworks begins, rising 
high in the sky and exploding into shapes of animals and trees with the dark sky and the moons and a 
million stars serving as a brilliant backdrop. 

"I can feel their desperation," I hear from somewhere. I turn and look around me. There is nobody 
there. "They know where one of the others is, but the charm still holds. They can't touch her until 
they've 

killed you first. But they continue to track her." 

I fly up high, then dip low, seeking the source of the voice. Where is it coming from? 
"Now is when we have to be most cautious. Now is when we have to stay ahead of them." 

I push forward towards the fireworks. The voice unnerves me. Perhaps the loud booms will drown it 
out. 

"They had hoped to kill us all well before your Legacies developed. But we've kept h idden. We have to 
stay calm. The first three panicked. The first three are dead. We have to stay smart and cautious. When 
we panic is when mistakes are made. They know it will only get harder for them the more developed the 
rest of you are, and when you are all fully developed, the war will be waged. We will hit back and seek 
our revenge, and they know it." 

I see the bombs fall from miles above Lorien's surface. Explosions shake the ground and the air, 
screams carry on the wind, bursts of fire sweep across the land and the trees. The forest burns. There 
must be a thousand different aircraft, all dropping from high in the sky to land on Lorien. Mogadorian 
soldiers pour out, carrying guns and grenades that hold powers far greater than what is used in warfare 
here. They are taller than we are, and still look similar except in the face. They have no pupils and their 
irises are a deep magenta color, some of them black. Dark, heavy circles rim their eyes and there's a 
pallor to their skinâ€”an almost discolored, bruised quality to it. Their teeth glint between lips that never 
seem to close, teeth that look filed, coming to an unnatural point. 

The beasts of Mogadore come off the planes close beh ind, the same cold look in their eyes. Some of 



them are as big as houses, razor teeth showing, roaring so loud that it hurts my ears. 

"We got careless, John. That is how we were defeated so easily," he says. I know now that the voice 
I'm hearing is Henri's. But he is nowhere to be seen, and I can't take my eyes off the killing and the 
destruction below me to look for him. People are running everywhere, fighting back. As many 
Mogadorians as Loric are being killed. But the Loric are losing the battle against the beasts, which are 
killing our people by the dozens: breathing fire, gnashing teeth, viciously swinging arms and tails. Time is 
speeding along, going much faster than normal. How much has passed? An hour? Two? 

The Garde lead the fight, their Legacies on full display. Some are flying, some able to run so fast that 
they become a blur, and some disappear entirely. Lasers shoot from hands, bodies become engulfed in 
flames, storm clouds are brewed coupled with harsh winds above those able to control the weather. But 
they are still losing. They are outnumbered five hundred to one. Their powers are not enough. 

"Our guard had dropped. The Mogadorians had planned well, picking that exact moment when they 
knew we were at our most vulnerable, when the planet's Elders were gone. Pittacus Lore, the greatest 
of 

them, their leader, had assembled them before the attack. Nobody knows what happened to them, or 
where they went, or if they are even still alive. Perhaps the Mogadorians took them out first, and once 
the 

Elders were out of the way, that is when they attacked. All we really know is that there was a column of 
shimmering white light that shot into the sky as far as anyone could see on the day the Elders 
assembled. 

It lasted the entire day, then vanished. We, as a people, should have recognized it as a sign that 
something was amiss, but we didn't. We have no one to blame but ourselves for what happened. We 
were lucky to get anyone off the planet, much less nine young Garde who might someday continue the 
fight, and keep our race alive." 

Off in the distance a ship shoots high and fast into the air, a blue stream following behind it. I watch it 
from my vantage point in the sky until it disappears. There is something familiar about it. And then it 



dawns on me: I am in that ship, and Henri is, too. It's the ship carrying us to Earth. The Loric must have 



known they were beaten. Why else would they send us away? 

Useless slaughter. That is how it all looks to me. I land on the ground and walk though a ball of fire. 

Rage sweeps through me. Men and women are dying, Garde and C pan, along with defenseless 

children. How can this be tolerated? How can the hearts of the Mogadorians be so hardened as to do all 
this? And why was I spared? 

I lunge at a nearby soldier but go straight through him and fall down. Everything I am witnessing has 
already happened. I'm a spectator of our own demise and there's nothing I can do. 

I turn around and face a beast that must be forty feet tall, broad shouldered, with red eyes and horns 
twenty feet in length. Drool falls from its long, sharp teeth. It lets out a roar, and then lunges. 

It passes through me but takes out dozens of Loric around me. Just like that, every one of them gone. 
And the beast keeps going, taking out more Loric. 

Through the scene of destruction I hear a scratching noise, something separate from the carnage on 

Lorien. I am drifting away, or drifting back. Two hands press down upon my shoulders. My eyes snap 

open and I'm back in our home in Ohio. My arms are dangling over the coffee table. Inches below them 

are two cauldrons of fire, and both of my hands and wrists are completely submerged in the flames. I 

don't feel the effects at all. Henri stands over me. The scratching I heard a minute ago is coming from 
the 

front porch. 



"What is that?" I whisper, sitting up. 



"I don't know," he says. 



We are both silent, straining to listen. Three more scratches at the door. Hen ri looks down at me. 
"There's somebody out there," he says. 

I look at the clock on the wall. Nearly an hour has passed. I'm sweating, out of breath, unsettled by the 
scenes of slaughter I just witnessed. For the first time in my life I truly understand what happened on 
Lorien. Before tonight the events were just part of another story, not all that different from the many I 
have read in books. But now I have seen the blood, the tears, the dead. I have seen the destruction. It's 
a part of who I am. 

Outside, darkness has set in. Three more scratches at the door, a low groan. We both jump. I 
immediately think of the low groans I heard coming from the beasts. 

Henri rushes into the kitchen and grabs a knife from the drawer beside the sink. "Get behind the couch." 
"What, why?" 
"Because I said so." 

"You think that little knife is going to take down a Mogadorian?" 
"If I hit them straight in the heart it will. Now get down." 



I scramble off the coffee table and crouch behind the sofa. The two cauldrons of fire are still going, faint 

visions of Lorien still moving through my mind. An impatient growl comes from the other side of the 
front 

door. There is no mistaking that somebody, or something, is out there. My heart races. 
"Keep down," Henri says. 

I lift my head so that I can peer over the back of the couch. All that blood, I think. Surely they knew 
they were outmatched. But they fought to the end anyway, dying to save each other, dying to save 
Lorien. Henri grips the knife tightly. He slowly reaches for the brass knob. Anger sweeps through me. I 
hope itis one of them. Let a Mogadorian come through that door. He'll meet his match. 

There's no way I'm staying behind this couch. I reach over and grab one of the cauldrons, thrust my 
hand into it and pull out a burning piece of wood with a pointed end. It's cool to the touch, but the fire 
burns on, sweeping over and around my hand. I hold the piece of wood like a dagger. Let them come, I 
think.There will be no more running. Henri looks over at me, takes a deep breath and rips the front door 
open. 



CHAPTER NINE 



EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY IS FLEXED, E VER YTHINGtense . Henri jumps through the 
doorway and I am ready to follow. I can feel thethud-thud-thud in my chest. My fingers are white 
knuckled around the piece of wood still burning. A gust of wind bursts through the door and the fire 
dances in my hand and crawls up my wrist. No one is there. All at once Henri's body relaxes and he 
chuckles, looking down at his feet. There, looking up at Henri through the tops of his eyes, is the same 
beagle I saw yesterday at school. The dog wags his tail and paws at the ground. Henri reaches down and 
pets him; then the dog pushes past and trots into the house with his tongue dangling. 

"What's he doing here?" I ask. 
"You know this dog?" 

"I saw him at school. He was following me around yesterday after you dropped me off. " 

I put the piece of wood back and wipe my hand on my jeans, leaving a trail of black ash down the front. 

The dog sits at my feet and looks up expectantly, his tail thumping against the hardwood floor. I sit on 
the 

couch and watch both fires burn. Now that the excitement of the situation is over, my mind goes back to 

what I just saw in my vision. I can still hear the screams in my ears, still see the way the blood 
shimmered 

in the grass in the moonlight, still see the bodies and fallen trees, the red glow in the eyes of the beasts 
of 

Mogadore and the terror in the eyes of the Loric. 



I look at Henri. "I saw what happened. At least the beginning of it. " 



He nods. "I thought you might." 



"I could hear your voice. Were you talking to me?" 



"Yes." 



"I don't understand," I say. "It was a massacre. There was too much hatred for them to only be 
interested in our resources. There was more to it than that." 

Henri sighs and sits on the coffee table across from me. The dog jumps into my lap. I pet him. He's 
filthy, his coat stiff and oily under my hand. There is a tag in the shape of a football attached to the front 
of his collar. It's an old tag, most of the brown paint worn away. I take it in my hand, the number 19 on 
one side, the nameBERNIE KOSAR on the other. 

"Bernie Kosar," I say. The dog wags his tail. "I guess that's his name, same as that dude in the poster on 
my wall. Popular guy around here, I guess." I run my hand down his back. "He doesn't seem like he has 
a home," I say. "And he's hungry." Somehow I can tell. 



Henri nods. He looks down at Bernie Kosar. The dog stretches out, rests his chin on his paws, and 

closes his eyes. I flip open the lighter and hold the flame over my fingers, then my palm, then run it up 
the 

underside of my arm. Only when the flame is an inch or two away from my elbow do I feel the burn. 
Whatever Henri has done has worked, and my resistance has spread. I wonder how long it will take until 
all of me becomes resistant. 

"So what happened?" I ask. 

Henri takes a deep breath. "I've had those visions, too. So real it's like you're there." 

"I never realized how bad it all was. I mean, I know you had told me, but I didn't truly understand it until 
I saw it with my own eyes." 

"The Mogadorians are different than we are, secretive and manipulative, untrusting of almost 
everything. 

They have certain powers, but they're not powers like ours. They are gregarious and thrive in crowded 
cities. The more densely populated, the better. That is why you and I stay out of cities now, ev en when 

living in one might make it easier to blend in. It would make it a hell of a lot easier for them to blend in 

as 

well. 

"About a hundred years ago Mogadore began to die, much like Lorien did twenty-five thousand years 
before that. They didn't respond the way we did, thoughâ€”didn't understand it the way the human 
population is beginning to now. They ignored it. They killed their oceans and flooded their rivers and 
lakes with waste and sewage to keep adding to their cities. The vegetation started to die, which caused 



the herbivores to die, and then the carnivores weren't far behind. They knew they had to do something 
drastic." 

Henri closes his eyes, remains silent for a full minute. 

"Do you know the closest life-sustaining planet to Mogadore?" he finally asks. 
"Yes, it's Lorien. Or was, I guess." 

Henri nods. "Yes, itis Lorien. And I'm sure you know now that it was our resources they were after." 

I nod. Bernie Kosar lifts his head and lets out a deep yawn. Henri heats a cooked chicken breast in the 
microwave, cuts it into strips, then carries the plate back to the couch and sets it in front of the dog. He 
eats with ferocity, as though he hasn't eaten in days. 

"There are a large number of Mogadorians on Earth," Henri continues. "I don't know how many are 



here, but I can feel them when I sleep. Sometimes I can see them in my dreams. I can never tell where 
they are, or what they are saying. But I see them. And I don't think the six of you are the only reason 



there are so many of them here." 



"What do you mean? Why else would they be here?" 

Henri looks me in the eye. "Do you know what the second-closest life-sustaining planet is to 
Mogadore?" 

I nod. "It's Earth, isn't it?" 

"Mogadore is double the size of Lorien, but Earth is five times the size of Mogadore. In terms of defense 

Earth is better prepared for an offensive because of its size. The Mogadorians will need to understand 

this planet better before they can attack. I can't necessarily tell you how we were defeated so easily 

because there's much of it I still don't understand. But I can say for sure that part of it was a 
combination 

of their knowledge of our planet and our people, and the fact that we had no defense other than our 
intelligence and the Garde's Legacies. Say what you will about the Mogadorians, but they are brilliant 
strategists when it comes to war." 

We sit through another silence, the wind still roaring outside. 

"I don't think they're interested in taking Earth's resources," Henri says. 

I sigh and look up at him. "Why not?" 

"Mogadore is still dying. Even though they've patched the more pressing matters, the planet's death is 
inevitable, and they know it. I think they're planning to kill the humans. I think they want to make Earth 



their permanent home." 



I bathe Bernie Kosar after dinner, using shampoo and conditioner. I brush him with an old comb left in 
one of the drawers from the last tenant. He looks and smells much better, but his collar still stinks. I 
throw it away. Before going to bed I hold open the front door for him, but he isn't interested in going 
back outside. Instead he lies down on the floor and rests his chin on his front paws. I can feel his desire 
to stay in the house with us. I wonder if he can feel my desire for the same. 

"I think we have a new pet," Henri says. 

I smile. As soon as I saw him earlier I was hoping Henri would let me keep him. 
"Looks like it," I say. 

A half hour later I crawl into bed and Bernie Kosar jumps up with me and curls into a ball at my feet. He 
is snoring within minutes. I lie on my back for a while, staring into the darkness, a million different 
thoughts swimming in my head. Images from the war: the greedy, hungry look of the Mogadorians; the 
angry, hard look of the beasts; the death and the blood. I think of the beauty of Lorien. Will it again 
sustain life, or will Henri and I go on waiting here on Earth forever? 

I try to push the thoughts and images from my mind, but they don't stay gone for very long. I get up and 
pace for a while. Bernie Kosar lifts his head and watches me, but then drops it and falls back to sleep. I 



sigh, grab my phone from the nightstand and go through it to make sure Mark James didn't mess with 

anything. Henri's number is still there, but it is no longer the only entry. Another number, listed under 
the 

name of "Sarah Hart" has been added. After the last bell rang, and before coming to my locker, Sarah 
added her number to my phone. 

I close the phone, set it on the nightstand, and smile. Two minutes pass and I check my phone again to 
make sure I wasn't seeing things. I wasn't. I snap it shut and set it down, only to lift it again five minutes 
later just to look at her number again. I don't know how long it takes to fall asleep, but I eventually do. 
When I wake in the morning my phone is still in my hand, resting against my chest. 



CHAPTER TEN 

BERNIE KOSAR IS SCRATCHING AT MY BEDROOMdoor when I wake. I let him outside. He 
patrols the yard, rushing along with his nose to the ground. Once he's covered all four corners he bolts 
across the yard and disappears into the woods. I close the door and jump into the shower. I walk out ten 
minutes later and he's back inside, sitting on the couch. His tail wags when he sees me. 



"You let him in?" I ask Henri, who is at the kitchen table with his laptop open and four newspapers 
stacked in front of him. 

"Yes." 

After a quick breakfast, we head out. Bernie Kosar rushes ahead of us, then stops and sits looking up at 
the passenger door of the truck. 

"That's kind of weird, don't you think?" I say. 

Henri shrugs. "Apparently he's no stranger to car rides. Let him in." 

I open the door and he jumps in. He sits in the middle seat with his tongue dangling. When we pull out 
of 

the driveway he moves into my lap and paws at the window. I roll it down and he sticks half his body 
out, mouth still open, the wind flapping his ears. Three miles later Henri pulls in to the school. I open the 
door and Bernie Kosar jumps out ahead of me. I lift him back into the truck but he jumps right back out. 
I lift him back in again and have to block him from jumping out while I close the truck door. He stands on 
his hind legs with his front paws on the ledge of the door, the window still down. I pat him on the head. 

"Have your gloves?" Henri asks. 

"Yep." 



"Phone?" 



"Yep." 



"How do you feel?" 



"I feel good," I say. 



"Okay. Call me if you have any sort of trouble." 

He pulls away and Bernie Kosar watches from the back window until the truck disappears around the 
turn. 

I feel a similar nervousness as I did the day before, but for different reasons. Part of me wants to see 
Sarah right away, though part of me hopes that I don't see her at all. I'm not sure what I'll say to her. 
What if I can't think of anything at all and stand there looking foolish? What if she's with Mark when I 
see her? Should I acknowledge her and risk another confrontation, or just walk by and pretend that I 
don't see either of them? At the very least I'll see them both in second period. There's no getting around 
that. 



I head to my locker. My bag is filled with books I was supposed to read the night before but never 
opened. Too many thoughts and images running through my head. They haven't gone away and it's hard 
to imagine they ever will. It was all so different from what I expected. Death isn't like what they show 
you in the movies. The sounds, the looks, the smells. So different. 

At my locker I notice immediately that something's off. The metal handle is cover ed with dirt, or what 
looks like dirt. I'm not sure if I should open it, but then I take a deep breath and force the handle up. 

The locker is half filled with manure and as I swing the door open, much of it comes pouring out onto 
the 

floor, covering my shoes. The smell is horrendous. I slam the door shut. Sam Goode was standing behind 
it and his sudden appearance from out of nowhere startles me. He is looking forlorn, wearing a white 
NASA T-shirt only slightly different from the one he wore yesterday. 

"Hi, Sam," I say. 

He looks down at the pile of manure on the floor, then back at me. 
"You, too?" I ask. 
He nods. 

"I'm going to the principal's office. Do you want to come?" 

He shakes his head, then turns and walks away without saying a word. I walk to Mr. Harris's office, 



knock on his door, then enter without waiting for his reply. He is sitting behind his desk, wearing a tie 
that 

is tiled with the school mascot, no less than twenty tiny pirate heads scattered across the front of it. He 
smiles proudly at me. 

"It's a big day, John," he says. I don't know what he is talking about. "The reporters from theGazette 
should be here within the hour. Front page!" 

Then I remember, Mark James's big interview with the local paper. 

"You must be very proud," I say. 

"I'm proud of each and every one of Paradise's students." The smile doesn't leave his face. He leans 
back in his chair, locks his fingers together, and rests his hands on his stomach. "What can I do for you?" 

"I just wanted to let you know that my locker was filled with manure this morning." 



"What do you mean v filled'?" 

"I mean the whole thing was full of manure." 



"With manure?" he asks confusedly. 



"Yes." 

He laughs. I'm taken aback by his total lack of regard, and anger surges through me. My face is warm. 

"I wanted to let you know so it could be cleaned. Sam Goode's locker is filled with it, too." 

He sighs and shakes his head. "I'll send Mr. Hobbs, the janitor, down immediately and we'll make a full 
investigation. " 

"We both know who did it, Mr. Harris." 

He flashes a patronizing grin at me. "I'll handle the investigation, Mr. Smith." 

There's no point in saying anything further, so I walk out of his office and head to the bathroom to run 
cold water over my hands and face. I have to calm down. I don't want to have to wear the gloves again 
today. Maybe I should do nothing at all, just let it slide. Will that end it? And besides, what other choice 
is there? I'm outmatched and my only ally is a hundred-pound sophomore with a penchant for the 
extraterrestrial. Maybe that isn't the whole truthâ€” maybe I have another ally in Sarah Hart. 

I look down. My hands are fine, no glow. I walk out of the bathroom. The janitor is already sweeping 

the manure from my locker, lifting out books and placing them in the trash. I walk past him and into the 

classroom and wait for class to start. Rules of grammar are discussed, the main topic being the 
difference 



between a gerund and a verb, and why a gerund is not a verb. I pay closer attention than I did the day 
before, but as the end of the period nears I start to get nervous about the next class. But not because I 
might see Mark... because I might see Sarah. Will she smile at me again today? I think it'll be best to 
arrive before she does so I can find my seat and watch her walk in. That way I can see if she says hello 
to me first. 

When the bell rings, I dash out of class and rush down the hall. I'm the first one to enter astronomy. The 
classroom fills and Sam sits beside me again. Just before the bell rings Sarah and Mark enter together. 
She's dressed in a white button-up shirt and black pants. She smiles at me before sitting down. I smile 
back. Mark doesn't look my way at all. I can still smell the manure on my shoes, or maybe the odor is 
coming from Sam's. 

He pulls a pamphlet from his bag with the titleThey Walk Among Us on the cover. It looks as though it 
was printed in somebody's basement. Sam flips to an article in the center and starts reading intently. 

I look at Sarah four desks in front of me, at her hair pulled back in a ponytail. I can see the nape of her 
slender neck. She crosses her legs and sits straight in her chair. I wish I were sitting beside her, that I 
could reach over and take her hand in mine. I wish it were eighth period already. I wonder if I'll be her 
partner in home ec again. 

Mrs. Burton begins lecturing. She's still on the topic of Saturn. Sam takes out a sheet of paper and 

begins scribbling wildly, pausing at times to consult an article in the magazine he has opened beside 
him. I 



look over his shoulder and read the title: "Entire Montana Town Abducted by Aliens." 

Before last night I would have never pondered such a theory. But Henri believes the Mogadorians are 

plotting to take over Earth, and I must admit, even though the theory in Sam's publication is ludicrous, 
at 

its most basic level there might be something there. I know for a fact that the Loric have visited Earth 

many times over the life of this planet. We watched Earth develop, watched it through the times of 

growth and abundance when everything moved, and through the times of ice and snow when nothing 
did. 

We helped the humans, taught them to make fire, gave them the tools to develop speech and language, 
which is why our language is so similar to the languages of Earth. And even though we never abducted 
humans, that doesn't mean it's never been done. I look at Sam. I've never met somebody with a 
fascination in aliens to the point of reading and taking notes on conspiracy theories. 

Just then the door opens and Mr. Harris sticks his smiling face in. 

"Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Burton. I'm going to have to snag Mark from you. TheGazette reporters are 
here to interview him for the paper," he says loudly enough so everyone in the class can hear. 

Mark stands, grabs his bag and casually strolls out of the room. From the doorway I see Mr. Harris pat 
him on the back. Then I look back at Sarah, wishing I could sit in the empty seat beside her. 



Fourth period is physical education. Sam is in my class. After changing we sit beside each other on the 
gymnasium floor. He is wearing tennis shoes, shorts, a T-shirt two or three sizes too large. He looks like 
a stork, all knees and elbows, somewhat lanky even though he's short. 

The gym teacher, Mr. Wallace, stands firmly in front of us, his feet shoulder width apart, his hands 
clenched into fists on his hips. 

"All right, guys, listen up. This is probably the last chance we'll get to work outdoors, so make it count. 
One-mile run, as hard as you can. Your times will be noted and saved for when we run the mile again in 
the spring. So run hard!" 

The outside track is made of synthetic rubber. It circles around the football field, and beyond it are 
some 

woods that I imagine might lead to our house, but I'm not sure. The wind is cool and goose bumps 
traverse the length of Sam's arms. He tries to rub them away. 

"Have you run this before?" I ask. 

Sam nods. "We ran it the second week of class." 

"What was your time?" 



"Nine minutes and fifty-four seconds." 



I look at him. "I thought skinny kids are supposed to be fast." 
"Shut up," he says. 

I run side by side with Sam towards the back of the crowd. Four laps. That is how many times I must 
circle the track to have run a mile. Halfway around I begin to pull away from Sam. I wonder how fast I 



could run a mile if I really tried. Two minutes, maybe one, maybe less? 

The exercise feels great, and without paying much attention, I pass the lead runner. Then I slow and 
feign 

exhaustion. When I do I see a brown and white blur come dashing out of the bushes by the entrance of 
the grandstand and head straight towards me. My mind is playing tricks on me , I think. I look away and 
keep running. I pass the teacher. He is holding a stopwatch. He yells words of encouragement but he is 
looking behind me, away from the track. I follow his eyes. They are fixated on the brown and white blur. 
It is still coming straight for me and all at once the images from the day before come rushing back. The 
Mogadorian beasts. There were small ones too, with teeth that glinted in the light like razor blades, fast 
creatures intent on killing. I start sprinting. 

I run halfway around the track in a dead sprint before I turn back around. There is nothing behind me. I 



have outrun it. Twenty seconds have passed. Then I turn back around and the thing is right in front of 
me. 

It must have cut across the field. I stop dead in my tracks and my perspective corrects itself. It's Bernie 
Kosar! He's sitting in the middle of the track with his tongue dangling, tail wagging. 

"Bernie Kosar!" I yell. "You scared the hell out of me!" 

I resume running at a slow pace and Bernie Kosar runs alongside me. I hope nobody noticed how fast I 
ran. Then I stop and bend over as though I have cramps and can't catch my breath. I walk for a bit. 
Then I jog a little. Before I finish the second lap two people have passed me. 

"Smith! What happened? You were dusting everyone!" Mr. Wallace yells when I run by him. 

I breathe heavily, for show. "Iâ€” haveâ€” asthma," I say. 

He shakes his head in disapproval. "And here I thought I had this year's Ohio state track champion in 
my class." 

I shrug and keep going, stopping every so often to walk. Bernie Kosar stays with me, sometimes 
walking, sometimes trotting. When I start the last lap Sam catches up to me and we run together. His 
face is bright red. 

"So what were you reading in astronomy today?" I ask. "An entire Montana town abducted by aliens?" 
He grins at me. "Yeah, that's the theory," he says somewhat shyly, as though embarrassed. 



"Why would an entire town be abducted?" 



Sam shrugs, doesn't answer. 



"No, really?" I ask. 



"Do you really want to know?" 



"Of course." 



"Well, the theory is that the government has been allowing alien abductions in exchange for 
technology." 



"Really? What kind of technology?" I ask. 



"Like chips for supercomputers and formulas for more bombs and green technologies. Stuff like that." 



"Green technology for live specimens? Weird. Why do aliens want to abduct humans?" 



"So they can study us." 



"But why? I mean, what reason could they possibly have?" 

"So that when Armageddon comes they'll know our weaknesses and be able to easily defeat us by 
exposing them. " 

I'm kind of taken aback by his answer, but only because of the scenes still playing in my head from the 
night before, remembering the weapons I saw the Mogadorians use, and the massive beasts. 

"Wouldn't it be easy for them if they already have bombs and technologies far superior to our own?" 

"Well, some people seem to think that they're hoping we'll kill ourselves first." 

I look at Sam. He is smiling at me, trying to decide whether I'm taking the conversation seriously. 

"Why would they want us to kill ourselv es first? What is their incentive?" 

"Because they're jealous." 

"Jealous of us? Why, because of our rugged good looks?" 
Sam laughs. "Something like that." 

I nod. We run in silence for a minute and I can tell Sam is hav ing a tough time, breathing heavily. "How 
did you get interested in all this?" 



He shrugs. "It's just a hobby," he says, though I get the distinct feeling that he's keeping something from 
me. 

We finish the mile at eight minutes fifty-nine seconds, better than the last time Sam ran it. Bernie Kosar 
follows the class back to the school. The others pet him, and when we walk in he tries to come in with 
us. I don't know how he knew where I was. Could he have memorized the way to the school this 
morning on the ride in? The thought seems ridiculous. 

He stays at the door. I walk to the locker room with Sam and the second he catches his breath he rattles 

off a ton of other conspiracy theories, one right after another, most of which are laughable. I like him, 
and 

find him amusing, but sometimes I wish he would stop talking. 



When home ec begins Sarah isn't in class. Mrs. Benshoff gives instruction for the first ten minutes and 

then we head to the kitchen. I enter the station alone, resigned to the fact that I'll be cooking alone 
today, 

and as soon as that thought occurs to me, Sarah walks in. 



"Did I miss anything good?" she asks. 



"About ten minutes of quality time with me," I say with a smile. 
She laughs. "I heard about your locker this morning. I'm sorry." 
"You put the manure there?" I ask. 

She laughs again. "No, of course not. But I know they're picking on you because of me." 

"They're just lucky I didn't use my superpowers and throw them into the next county." 

She playfully grabs my biceps. "Right, these huge muscles. Your superpowers. Boy, they are lucky." 

Our project for the day is to make blueberry cupcakes. As we start mixing the batter, Sarah begins 

telling me about her history with Mark. They dated for two years, but the longer they were together, the 

more she drifted from her parents and her friends. She was Mark's girlfriend, nothing else. She knew she 

had started to change, to adopt some of his attitudes towards people: being mean and judgmental, 

thinking she was better than them. She also started drinking and her grades slipped. At the end of the 
last 

school year, her parents sent her to live with her aunt in Colorado for the summer. When she got there, 

she started taking long hikes in the mountains, taking pictures of the scenery with her aunt's camera. 
She 

fell in love with photography and had the best summer ever, realizing there was far more to life than 
being 

a cheerleader and dating the quarterback of the football team. When she got home she broke up with 



Mark and quit cheerleading, and made a vow that she was going to be good, and kind, to everyone. 
Mark hasn't gotten over it. She says he still considers her his girlfriend, and believes she's going to come 
back to him. She says the only thing she misses about him are his dogs, which she hung out with 
whenever she was at his house. I then tell her about Bernie Kosar, and how he showed up at our 
doorstep unexpectedly after that first morning at the school. 

We work as we talk. At one point I reach into the oven without the oven mitts and pull out the cupcake 
pan. She sees me do it and asks if I'm okay, and I pretend to be hurt, shake my hand as if it's burned, 
though I don't actually feel a thing. We go to the sink and Sarah runs lukewarm water to help with the 
burn that isn't there. When she sees my hand, I just shrug. As we're frosting the cupcakes, she asks 
about my phone, and tells me she noticed there was only one number in it. I tell her it's Henri's number, 
that I lost my old phone with all of my contacts. She asks if I left a girlfriend behind when we moved. I 
say no, and she smiles, which just about ruins me. Before class ends, she tells me about the upcoming 
Halloween festival in town, and says she hopes to see me there, that maybe we can hang out. I say yeah, 
that would be great, and pretend to be cool, even though I'm flying inside. 



CHAPTER ELEVEN 



IMAGES COME TO ME, AT RANDOM TIMES, USUALLYwhen I least expect them. Sometimes 

they are small and fleetingâ€”my grandmother holding a glass of water and opening her mouth to say 

somethingâ€”but I never know the words because the image vanishes as quickly as it came. Sometimes 

they are longer, more lifelike: my grandfather pushing me on a swing. I can feel the strength in his arms 
as 



he pushes me up, the butterflies in the pit of my stomach as I race down. My laughter carries on the 
wind. 

Then the image is gone. Sometimes I explicitly remember the images from my past, remember being a 
part of them. But sometimes they are as new to me as though they never happened before. 

In the living room, with Henri running the Loric crystal up each of my arms, my hands suspended over 



flames, I see the following: I am youngâ€”three, maybe fourâ€” running through our front yard of newly 
clipped grass. Beside me is an animal with a body like a dog, but with a coat like a tiger. His head is 
round, his body barrel chested atop short legs. Unlike any animal I have ever seen. He crouches, poised 
to leap at me. I can't stop laughing. Then he jumps and I try to catch him but I'm too small and both of us 
fall to the grass. We wrestle. He is stronger than I am. Then he jumps in the air, and instead of falling 
back to the ground as I expect, he turns himself into a bird and flies up and around me, hovering just 
beyond my reach. He circles, then comes down, shoots between my legs, lands twenty feet away. He 
changes into an animal that looks like a monkey without a tail. He crouches low to lunge at me. 

Just then a man comes up the walk. He is young, dressed in a silver and blue rubber suit that is tight on 
his body, the kind of suit I've seen divers wear. He speaks to me in a language that I don't understand. 
He says the name "Hadley" and nods to the animal. Hadley runs over to him, his shape changing from a 
monkey to something larger, something bearlike with a lion's mane. Their heads are level, and the man 



scratches Hadley beneath the chin. Then my grandfather comes out of the house. He looks young, but I 
know that he must be at least fifty. 

He shakes hands with the man. They speak but I don't understand what they are saying. Then the man 

looks at me, smiles, lifts his hand out, and all of a sudden I'm off the ground and flying through the air. 

Hadley follows, as a bird again. I'm in full control of my body, but the man controls where I go, moving 

his hand to the left or to the right. Hadley and I play in midair, him tickling me with his beak, me trying 
to 

get a grip on him. And then my eyes snap open and the image is gone. 

"Your grandfather could make himself invisible at will," I hear Henri say, and I close my eyes again. The 
crystal continues up my arm, spreading the fire repellent to the rest of my body. "One of the rarest 
Legacies there is, developing only in one percent of our people, and he was one of them. He could make 
himself and whatever he was touching completely disappear. 

"There was one time he wanted to play a joke on me, before I knew what his Legacies were. You were 

three years old and I had just started working with your family. I came to your house for the first time 
the 

day before, and as I came up the hill for my second day the house wasn't there. There was a driveway, 
and a car, and the tree, but no house. I thought I was losing my mind. I continued past it. Then when I 
knew I had gone too far I turned back and there, some distance away, was the house that I swore 
wasn't there before. So I started walking back, but when I came close enough the house again vanished. 
I just stood there looking at the spot where I knew it must be, but seeing only the trees beyond it. So I 
walked on. Only on my third time by did your grandfather make the house reappear for good. He 
couldn't stop laughing. We laughed about that day for the next year and a half, all the way till the very 
end." 



When I open my eyes I am back on the battlefield. More explosions, fire, death. 

"Your grandfather was a good man," Henri says. "He loved to make people laugh, loved to tell jokes. I 
don't think there was ever a time that I left your house without having a stomachache from laughing so 
hard." 

The sky has turned red. A tree rips through the air, thrown by the man in silver and blue, the one I saw 
at the house. It takes out two of the Mogadorians and I want to cheer in victory. But what use is there in 

celebrating? No matter how many Mogadorians I see killed, the outcome of that day will not change. 
The 

Loric will still be defeated, ev ery last one of them killed. I will still be sent to Earth. 

"I never once saw the man get angry. When everyone else lost their temper, when stress encompassed 
them, your grandfather stayed calm. It was usually then that he would bring out his best jokes, and just 



like that everyone would be laughing again. " 

The small beasts target the children. They are defenseless, holding sparklers in their hands from the 
celebration. That is how we are losingâ€”only a few of the Loric are fighting the beasts, and the rest are 



trying to save the children. 



"Your grandmother was different. She was quiet and reserved, v ery intelligent. Your elders 

complemented each other that way, your grandfather the carefree one, your grandmother working 
behind 

the scenes so that everything went off as planned." 

High in the sky I can still see the trail of blue smoke from the airship carrying us to Earth, carrying us 
Nine and our Keepers. Its presence unnerves the Mogadorians. 

"And then there was Julianne, my wife." 

Far off in the distance there is an explosion, this one like the kind that comes from the liftoff of Earth's 
rockets. Another ship rises in the air, a trail of fire behind it. Slowly at first, then building speed. I'm 

confused. Our ships didn't use fire for liftoff; they didn't use oil or gasoline. They emitted a small blue 
trail 

of smoke that came from the crystals used to power them, never fire like this one. The second ship is 
slow and clumsy compared to the first, but it makes it, rising through the air, gaining speed. Henri never 
mentioned a second ship. Who is on it? Where is it going? The Mogadorians shout and point at it. Again, 
it causes them anxiety, and for a brief moment the Loric surge. 

"She had the greenest eyes I'd ever seen, bright green like emeralds, plus a heart as big as the planet 
itself. Always helping others, constantly bringing in animals and keeping them as pets. I'll never know 
what it was she saw in me." 

The large beast has returned, the one with the red eyes and enormous horns. Drool mixed with blood 



falls from razor-sharp teeth so large they can't be contained within its mouth. The man in silv er and blue 
is 

standing directly in front of it. He tries to lift the beast with his powers, and he gets it a few feet off the 

ground but then struggles and lifts no farther. The beast roars, shakes, and falls back to the ground. It 

forces ahead against the man's powers, but it can't break them. The man lifts it again. Sweat and blood 

glisten in the moonlight on his face. Then he doubles his hands over and the beast crashes to its side. 
The 

ground shakes. Thunder and lightning fill the sky but there's no rain to go with them. 

"She was a late sleeper, and I always woke before she did. I would sit in the den and read the paper, 
make breakfast, go for a walk. Some mornings I would come back and she would still be sleeping. I was 
impatient, couldn't wait to start the day together. She made me feel good just to be around her. I would 
go in and try to rouse her. She would pull the covers over her head and growl at me. Almost every 
morning, always the same thing. " 

The beast flails but the man is still in control. Other Garde have joined in, every one of them using a 

power on the mammoth beast, fire and lightning raining down upon it, streaks of lasers coming from all 

directions. Some Garde are doing damage unseen, standing away from it and holding their hands out in 

concentration. And then high up a collective storm brews, one major cloud growing and glowing in an 

otherwise cloudless sky, some sort of energy collecting within it. All Garde are in on it, all of them 
helping 

to create this cataclysmic haze. And then a final, massive bolt of lightning drops down and hits the beast 
where it lies. And there it dies. 

"What could I do? What could anyone do? In total there were nineteen of us on that ship. You nine 

children and us nine C pan, chosen by no means other than where we happened to be that night, and 
the 



pilot who brought us here. We C pan couldn't fight, and what difference would it have made if we 

could? The C pan are bureaucrats, meant to keep the planet running, meant to teach, meant to train 
new 

Garde how to understand and manipulate their powers. We were never meant to be fighters. We would 
have been ineffective. We would have died like the rest. All we could do was leave. Leave with you to 
live and to one day restore to glory the most beautiful planet in all of the universe." 

I close my eyes and when I reopen them the fight has ended. Smoke rises from the ground among the 

dead and the dying. Trees broken, the forests burned, nothing standing save the few Mogadorians that 

have lived to tell the tale. The sun rising to the south and a pale glow growing on the barren land bathed 
in 

red. Mounds of bodies, not all of them intact, not all of them whole. On top of one mound is the man in 
silver and blue, dead like the rest. There are no discernible marks on his body, but he is dead all the 
same. 

My eyes snap open. I can't breathe, and my mouth is dry, parched. 

"Here," Henri says. He helps me off the coffee table, guides me into the kitchen and pulls out a chair for 
me. Tears are coming to my eyes though I try to blink them back. Henri brings me a glass of water and I 



drink every bit of it without stopping. I give him the glass and he refills it. I drop my head, still struggling 
to breathe. I drink the second glass, then look at Henri. 

"Why didn't you ever tell me about a second ship?" I ask. 

"What are you talking about?" 

"There was a second ship," I say. 

"Where was there a second ship?" 

"On Lorien, the day we left. A second ship that took off after ours." 
"Impossible," he says. 
"Why is it impossible?" 

"Because the other ships were destroyed. I saw it with my own eyes. When the Mogadorians landed 
they took out our ports first. We traveled in the only ship that survived their offensive. It was a miracle 
that we made it off." 

"I saw a second ship. I'm telling you. It wasn't like the others, though. It ran on fuel, a ball of fire 
following behind it." 

Henri watches me closely. He is thinking hard, his brows crinkled. 



"Are you sure, John?" 



"Yes." 



He leans back in his chair, looks out the window. Bernie Kosar is on the ground, staring up at us both. 



"It made it off Lorien," I say. "I watched it the whole way until it disappeared." 



Generated by ABC Amber LIT Conv erter, http://www.processtext.com /abclit.html 



"That makes no sense," Henri says. "I don't see how it could be possible. There was nothing left." 



"There was a second ship." 



We sit through a long silence. 



"Henri?" 



"Yes?" 



"What was on that ship?" 
He fixes me with a stare. 
"I don't know," he says. "I truly don't know." 



We sit in the living room, a fire in the hearth, Bernie Kosar in my lap. An occasional pop from the logs 
breaks the silence. 

"On!" I say, and snap my fingers. My right hand illuminates, not as brightly as I've seen it before, but 

close. In the short amount of time since Henri started coaching me I've learned to control the glow. I can 

concentrate it, making it wide, like the light in a house, or narrow and focused, like a flashlight. My 
ability 

to manipulate it is coming more quickly than I expected. The left hand is still dimmer than the right, but 
it's 

catching up. I snap my fingers and say "on" just to show off, but I don't need to do either to control the 

light, or to have it come on. It just happens from within, as effortlessly as twitching a finger or blinking 
an 

eye. 

"When do you think the other Legacies will develop?" I ask. 

Henri looks up from the paper. "Soon," he says. "The next one should start within the month, whatever 
it 

is. You just have to keep a close watch. Not all the powers will be obvious like your hands." 



"How long will it take for them all to come?" 

He shrugs. "Sometimes all is complete within two months, sometimes it takes up to a year. It varies from 
Garde to Garde. But however long it takes, your major Legacy will be the last to develop." 

I close my eyes and lean back against the couch. I think about my major Legacy, the one that will allow 
me to fight. I'm not sure what I want it to be. Lasers? Mind control? The ability to manipulate the 
weather as I had seen the man in silver and blue do? Or do I want something darker, more sinister, like 
the ability to kill without touching? 

I run my hand down Bernie Kosar's back. I look over at Henri. He's wearing a nightcap and a pair of 
spectacles on the tip of his nose like a storybook rat. 

"Why were we at the airfield that day?" I ask. 

"We were there for an air show. After it was over we took a tour of some of the ships." 



"Was that really the only reason?" 



He turns back to me and nods. He swallows hard, and it makes me think that he's keeping something 
from me. 

"Well, how was it decided that we would leave?" I ask. "I mean, surely a plan like that would've needed 
more time than a few minutes' notice, right?" 

"We didn't take off until three hours after the invasion started. Do you not remember any of it?" 
"Very little." 

"We met your grandfather at the statue of Pittacus. H e gave you to me and told me to get you to the 

airfield, that that was our only chance. There was an underground compound beneath the airfield. He 
said 

there had always been a contingency plan in case something of the sort occurred, but it was never taken 
seriously because the threat of an attack seemed ludicrous. Just like it would be here, on Earth. If you 
were to tell any human now that there is a threat of an attack by aliens, well, they would laugh at you. It 
was no different on Lorien. I asked him how he knew about the plan and he didn't answer, just smiled, 
and said good-bye. It makes sense that no one would really know about the plan, or only a few would." 

I nod. "So just like that, you guys came up with a plan to come to Earth?" 

"Of course not. One of the planet's Elders met us at the airfield. He's the one who cast the Loric charm 
that branded your ankles and tied you all together, and gave you each an amulet. He said you were 
special children, blessed children, by which I assume he meant you were getting a chance to escape. We 



originally planned to take the ship up and wait out the invasion, wait for our people to fight back and 
win. 

But that never happened...," he says, trailing off. Then he sighs. "We stayed in orbit for a week. That 
was how long it took for the Mogadorians to strip Lorien of everything. After it became clear that there 
would be no going back, we set our course for Earth." 

"Why didn't he cast a charm so that none of us could be killed, regardless of numbers?" 

"There's only so much that can be done, John. What you are talking about is invincibility. It's not 
possible." 

I nod. The charm only does so much. If one of the Mogadorians tries killing us out of order, whatever 

damage it attempts is reversed and done to it instead. If one had tried shooting me in the head the 
bullet 

would have gone through its own head. But not anymore. Now if they catch me, I die. 

I sit in silence for a moment thinking about it all. The airfield. Lorien's lone remaining Elder who cast the 

charm on us, Loridas, now dead. The Elders were the first inhabitants of Lorien, those beings who made 

it what it was. There were ten of them in the beginning, and they contained all Legacies within them. So 

old, so long ago that they seem more of a myth than anything based in reality. Aside from Loridas, no 
one 

knew what had happened to the rest of them, if they were dead. 

I try to remember what it was like orbiting the planet waiting to see if we could go back, but I don't 
remember any of it. I can recall bits and pieces of the journey. The interior of the ship we traveled in was 
round and open aside from the two bathrooms that had doors. There were cots pushed to one side; the 
other side was devoted to exercise and games to keep us from getting too antsy. I can't remember what 



the others look like. I can't remember the games we played. I remember being bored, an entire year 
being spent inside an airship with seventeen others. There was a stuffed animal I slept with at night, and 



though I'm sure the memory is wrong, I seem to recall the animal playing back. 

"Henri?" 

"Yes?" 

"I keep having images of a man in a silver and blue suit. I saw him at our house, and on the battlefield. 
He could control the weather. And then I saw him dead." 

Henri nods. "Every time you travel back it'll only be to those scenes holding relevance to you." 
"He was my father, wasn't he?" 

"Yes," he says. "He wasn't supposed to come around much, but he did anyway. He was around a lot." 
I sigh. My father had fought valiantly, killing the beast and many of the soldiers. But in the end it still 



wasn't enough. 



"Do we really have a chance to win?" 
"What do you mean?" 

"We were defeated so easily. What hope is there for a different outcome if we're found? Even when we 
have all developed our powers, and when we finally come together and are ready to fight, what hope do 
we have against things like those?" 

"Hope?" he says. "There is always hope, John. New developments have yet to present themselves. Not 
all the information is in. No. Don't give up hope just yet. It's the last thing to go. When you have lost 
hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always 
hope." 



CHAPTER TWELVE 

HENRI AND I GO INTO TOWN ON SATURDAY FORthe Halloween parade, almost two weeks 

after arriving in Paradise. I think the solitude is getting to us both. Not that we aren't used to solitude. 
We 

are. But the solitude in Ohio is different from that of most other places. There is a certain silence to it, a 
certain loneliness. 



It's a cold day, the sun peeking intermittently through thick white clouds gliding by overhead. The town 
is bustling. All the kids are in costume. We have bought a leash for Bernie Kosar, who is wearing a 
Superman cape draped over his back, a large "S" on his chest. He seems unimpressed with it. He's not 
the only dog dressed as a superhero. 

Henri and I stand on the sidewalk in front of the Hungry Bear, the diner just off the circle in the center 
of 

town, to watch the parade. In its front window hangs a clipping of theGazette article on Mark James. 
He's pictured standing on the fifty-yard line of the football field, wearing his letterman jacket, his arms 
crossed, his right foot resting atop a football, a wry, confident grin on his face. Even I have to admit he 
looks impressive. 



Henri sees me staring at the paper. 

"It's your friend, right?" he asks with a smile. Henri now knows the story, from the near fight to the cow 
manure to the crush I have on his ex-girlfriend. Since finding out all this information he has only referred 
to Mark as my "friend." 

"Mybest friend," I correct him. 



Just then the band starts. It's at the head of the parade, followed by various Halloween -themed floats, 
one of which is carrying Mark and a few of the football players. Some I recognize from class, some I 
don't. They throw handfuls of candy to the kids. Then Mark catches sight of me and he nudges the guy 
beside himâ€” Kevin, the kid I kneed in the groin in the cafeteria. Mark points at me and says something. 
They both laugh. 

"That's him?" Henri asks. 

"That's him." 

"Looks like a dick." 

"I told you." 

Then come the cheerleaders, walking, all in uniform, hair pulled back, smiling and waving to the crowd. 

Sarah is walking alongside them, taking pictures. She gets them in action, while they're jumping, doing 

their cheers. Despite the fact that she's wearing jeans and no makeup, she's far more beautiful than any 

of them. We've been talking more and more at school, and I can't stop thinking about her. Henri sees 
me 

staring at her. 

Then he turns back to the parade. "That's her, huh?" 



"That's her." 



She sees me and waves, then points to the camera, meaning she'd come over but wants to take 
pictures. 

I smile and nod. 

"Well," Henri says. "I can certainly see the appeal." 

We watch the parade. The mayor of Paradise passes by, sitting on the back of a red convertible. He 
throws more candy to the children. There will be a lot of hyper kids today, I think. 

I feel a tap on my shoulder and turn around. 

"Sam Goode. What's the word?" 

He shrugs. "Nothin". What's up with you?" 

"Watching the parade. This is my dad, Henri." 

They shake hands. Henri says, "John has told me a lot about you." 



"Really?" Sam asks with a crooked grin. 



"Really," Henri responds. Then he pauses a minute and a smile takes shape. "You know, I've been 
reading. Maybe you've heard it already, but did you know that aliens are the reason we have 
thunderstorms? They create them in order to enter our planet unnoticed. The storm creates a diversion, 
and the lightning you see is really coming from the spaceships entering Earth's atmosphere." 

Sam smiles and scratches his head. "Get out of here," he says. 

Henri shrugs. "That's what I've heard." 

"All right," Sam says, more than willing to oblige Henri. "Well, did you know that the dinosaurs really 
didn't go extinct? Aliens were so fascinated by them that they decided to gather them all up and take 
them to their own planet." 

Henri shakes his head. "I didn't know that," he says. "Did you know that the Loch Ness monster was 
really an animal from the planet Trafalgra? They brought him here as an experiment, to see if he could 
survive, and he did. But when he was discovered the aliens had to take him back, which is why he was 
never spotted again." 

I laugh, not at the theory, but at the name Trafalgra. There is no planet named Trafalgra and I wonder if 
Henri has made it up on the fly. 

"Did you know the Egyptian pyramids were built by aliens?" 

"I've heard that," Henri says, smiling. This is funny to him because though the pyramids weren't actually 



built by aliens, they were built using Lorien knowledge and with Lorien help. "Did you know the world is 
supposed to end on December 21, 2012?" 

Sam nods and grins. "Yeah, I've heard that. Earth's supposed expiration date, the end of the Mayan 
calendar." 

"Expiration date?" I chime in. "Like, a v best if used before' date that's printed on milk cartons? Is Earth 
going to curdle?" 

I laugh at my own joke, but Sam and Henri pay me no attention. 

Then Sam says, "Did you know crop circles were originally used as a navigational tool for the Agharian 
alien race? But that was thousands of years ago. Today they are only created by bored farmers." 

I laugh again. I have the urge to ask what sorts of people create alien conspiracies if it is bored farmers 
who create crop circles, but I don't. 

"How about the Centuri?" asks Henri. "Do you know of them?" 
Sam shakes his head. 

"They're a race of aliens living at Earth's core. They are a contentious race, in constant discord with one 
another, and when they have civil wars Earth's surface is thrown off-kilter. That's when things such as 
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. The tsunami of 2004? All because the Centuri king's daughter 



went missing." 



"Did they find her?" I ask. 

Henri shakes his head, looks at me, then back at Sam, who is still smiling at the game. "They never did. 
Theorists believ e she is able to shift her shape, and that she is living somewhere in South America." 

Henri's theory is so good, I think there's no way he made it up that quickly. I stand there and actually 
ponder it, even though I've never heard of aliens called the Centuri, even when I know for a fact that 
nothing lives at Earth's core. 

"Did you know..." Sam pauses. I think Henri has stumped him, and as soon as that thought pops into 
my mind Sam says something so frightening that a wave of terror shoots through me. 

"Did you know that the Mogadorians are on a quest for universal domination, and that they have 
already 

wiped out one planet and are planning to wipe Earth out next? They're here seeking human weakness 
so 

that they can exploit us when the war begins." 



My mouth drops open and Henri stares at Sam, dumbfounded. He's holding his breath. His hand 
tightens around his coffee cup until I'm afraid that if it tightens any further the cup will crumple. Sam 
glances at Henri, then at me. 



"You guys look like you've seen a ghost. Does this mean I win?" 

"Where did you hear that?" I ask. Henri looks at me so fiercely that I wish I had remained silent. 
"FromThey Walk Among Us ." 

Henri still can't think of how to respond. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes. Then a petite 
woman standing behind Sam interrupts. 

"Sam," she says. He turns and looks at her. "Where have you been?" 

Sam shrugs. "I was standing right here." 

She sighs, then says to Henri, "Hi, I'm Sam's mother." 

"Henri," he says, and shakes her hand. "Pleased to meet you." 

She opens her eyes in surprise. Something in Henri's accent has excited her. 

"Ah bon! Vous parlez fran ais? C'est super! J'ai personne avec qui je peux parler fran ais depuis 
long-temps." 



Henri smiles. "I'm sorry. I don't actually speak French. I know my accent sounds like it, though." 



"No?" She is disappointed. "Well hell, here I thought some dignity had finally come to town." 



Sam looks at me and rolls his eyes. 



"All right, Sam, let's get going," she says. 



He shrugs. "You guys gonna go to the park and the hayride?" 



I look at Henri, then at Sam. "Yeah, sure," I say. "Are you?" 



He shrugs. 



"Well, try to come meet us if you can," I say. 



He smiles and nods. "Okay, cool." 



"Time to go, Sam. And you might not be able to go on the hayride. I need your help at home," his 
mother says. He starts to say something but she walks away. Sam follows her. 

"Very nice woman," Henri says sarcastically. 



"How did you make all that up?" I ask. 

The crowd begins migrating up Main Street, away from the circle. Henri and I follow it up to the park, 
where cider and food are being served. 

"You lie long enough and you start to get used to it." 

I nod. "So what do you think?" 

He takes a deep breath and exhales. The temperature is cold enough so that I can see his breath. "I have 
no idea. I don't know what to think at this point. He caught me off guard." 

"He caught us both off guard." 

"We're going to have to look into the publication he's getting his information from, find out who is 
writing it and where it's being written." 

He looks over at me expectantly. 



"What?" 



"You're going to have to get a copy," he says. 



"I will," I say. "But still, it makes no sense. How could somebody know that?" 



"It's being supplied from somewhere." 



"Do you think it's one of us?" 



"No." 



"Do you think it's them?" 



"It could be. I've never thought to check the conspiracy-theory rags. Perhaps they think we read them 
and can root us out by leaking information like that. I mean..." He pauses, thinks about it for a minute. 
"Hell, John, I don't know. We'll have to look into it, though. It's not a coincidence, that's for sure." 



We walk in silence, still a little stunned, turning possible explanations over in our minds. Bernie Kosar 

trots along between us, tongue dangling, his cape falling to one side and dragging on the sidewalk. He's 
a 

big hit with the kids and many of them stop us to pet him. 



The park is situated on the southern edge of town. At the far border are two adjacent lakes separated 

by a narrow strip of land leading into the forest beyond them. The park itself is made up of three 
baseball 

fields, a playground, and a large pavilion where volunteers serve cider and slices of pumpkin pie. Three 
hay wagons are off to the side of the gravel drive, with a large sign reading: 



BE SCARED OUT OF YOUR WITS ! 



HALLOWEEN HAUNTED HAYRIDES 



STARTÂ® SUNDOWN 



$5 PER PERSON 



The drive segues from gravel to dirt before it reaches the woods, the entrance to which is decorated 
with 

cutouts of ghost and goblin caricatures. It appears that the haunted hayride travels through the woods. I 
look around for Sarah but don't see her anywhere. I wonder if she'll be going on it. 



Henri and I enter the pavilion. The cheerleaders are off to the side, some of them doing 

Hallo ween-themed face paintings for the kids, the others selling raffle tickets for the drawing to be held 
at 

six p.m. 

"Hi, John," I hear behind me. I turn around and there's Sarah, holding her camera. "How did you like 
the parade?" 

I smile at her and slide my hands into my pockets. There's a small white ghost painted on her cheek. 
"Hey, you," I say. "I liked it. I'm think I'm getting used to this small-town Ohio charm." 
"Charm? You mean boringness, right?" 
I shrug. "I don't know, it isn't bad." 

"Hey, it's the little guy from school. I remember you," she says, bending down to pet Bernie Kosar. He 
wags his tail wildly, jumps up and tries to lick her face. Sarah laughs. I look over my shoulder. Henri is 
twenty feet away, talking to Sarah's mom at one of the picnic tables. I'm curious to know what they're 
talking about. 



"I think he likes you. His name is Bernie Kosar." 



"Bernie Kosar? That's no name for an adorable dog. Look at this cape. It's, like, cute overload." 
"You know if you keep that up I'm going to be jealous of my own dog," I say. 
She smiles and stands. 

"So are you going to buy a raffle ticket from me or what? It's to rebuild a not-for-profit animal shelter 
destroyed in a fire last month in Colorado." 

"Really? How does a girl from Paradise, Ohio, learn of an animal shelter in Colorado?" 

"It's my aunt's. I've convinced all the girls on the cheerleading squad to participate. We're going to take 

a trip and assist in the construction. We'll be helping the animals and getting out of school and Ohio for 
a 

week. It's a win-win situation." 

I picture Sarah dressed in a hard hat, wielding a hammer. The thought brings a grin to my face. "So 
you're saying I'm going to have to cover the kitchen alone for a whole week?" I fake an exasperated sigh 
and shake my head. "I don't know if I can support such a trip now, even if it is for the animals." 

She laughs and punches me in the arm. I take out my wallet and give her five dollars for six tickets. 



"These six are good luck," she says. 
"They are?" 

"Of course. You bought them from me, silly." 

Just then, over Sarah's shoulder, I see Mark and the rest of the guys from the float walk into the 
pavilion. 

"Are you going on the haunted hayride tonight?" Sarah asks. 
"Yeah, I was thinking about it." 

"You should, it's fun. Everybody does it. And it actually gets pretty scary." 

Mark sees Sarah and me talking and scrunches his face into a scowl. He comes walking our way. Same 
outfit as always â€” letterman jacket, blue jeans, hair full of gel. 

"So you're going?" I ask Sarah. 

Before she can respond Mark interrupts. "How'd you like the parade, Johnny?" he asks. Sarah quickly 
turns around and glares at him. 

"I liked it a lot," I reply. 



"You going on the haunted hayride tonight, or are you going to be too scared?" 



I smile at him. "As a matter of fact, I am going." 



"You going to have a freak-out like in school and run out of the woods crying like a baby?" 



"Don't be an ass, Mark," Sarah says. 

He looks at me, seething. With the crowd around there is nothing he can do without causing a 
sceneâ€”and I don't think he would do anything anyway. 

"All in due time," Mark says. 

"You think?" 

"Yours is coming," he says. 



"That might be true," I say. "But it won't be coming from you." 



"Stop it!" Sarah yells. She works her way in between us, pushing us away from each other. People are 
watching. She glances around as though embarrassed by the attention, then scowls at Mark first, then at 
me. 

"Fine, then. You guys fight if that's what you want to do. Good luck with it," Sarah says, and turns and 
walks away. I watch her go. Mark doesn't. 

"Sarah," I call, but she keeps walking and disappears past the pavilion. 

"Soon," Mark says. 

I look back to him. "I doubt it. " 

He retreats to his group of friends. Henri walks up to me. 

"I don't suppose he was inquiring about yesterday's math homework?" 

"Not quite," I say. 

"I wouldn't worry about him," Henri says. "He looks to be all talk." 

"I'm not," I say, and then glance at the spot where Sarah disappeared. "Should I go after her?" I ask, 
and look at him, pleading to the part of him that was once married and in love, that part that still misses 
his wife ev ery day, and not the par t of him that wants to keep me safe and hidden. 



He nods his head. "Yeah," he says with a sigh. "As much as I hate to admit it, you should probably go 
after her." 



CHAPTER THIRTEEN 



KIDS RUNNING, SCREAMING, ON SLIDES ANDjungle gyms. Every kid with a bag of candy in 

his or her hand, with a mouth stuffed full of sweets. Kids dressed as cartoon characters, monsters, 
ghouls 

and ghosts. Every resident of Paradise must be at the park right now. And in the midst of all the 
madness 

I see Sarah, sitting alone, gently pushing herself on the swing. 



I weave my way through the screams and shrieks. When Sarah sees me she smiles, those big blue eyes 
of hers like a beacon. 



"Need a push?" I ask. 



She nods to the swing that has just opened beside her and I sit. 
"Doing okay?" I ask. 

"Yeah, I'm fine. He just wears me down. He always has to act so tough and he's downright mean when 
he's around friends." 

She twists herself on the swing until the rope becomes taut, then she lifts her feet and it spins her 
around, 

slowly at first, then gaining speed. She laughs the whole time, her blond hair a trail behind her. I do the 
same thing. When the swing finally stops the world keeps spinning. 

"Where is Bernie Kosar?" 

"I left him with Henri," I say. 

"Your dad?" 

"Yes, my dad." I am constantly doing that, calling Henri by his name when I should be saying "Dad." 

The temperature is quickly dropping, and my hands are white knuckled on the rope chain, becoming 
cold. We watch the kids run amok around us. Sarah looks at me and her eyes seem bluer than ever in 
the coming dusk. Our gaze stays locked, each of us just staring at the other, no words being said but 
much passing between us. The children seem to fade into the background. Then she smiles shyly and 
looks away. 



"So what are you going to do?" I ask. 



"About what?" 
"Mark." 

She shrugs. "What can I do? I've already broken up with him. I keep telling him I have no interest in 
getting back together." 

I nod. I'm not sure how to respond to that. 

"But anyway, I should probably try to sell the rest of these tickets. Only an hour before the raffle." 
"Do you want any help?" 

"No, that's okay. You should go have fun. Bernie Kosar is probably missing you right now. But you 
should definitely stick around for the hayride. Maybe we can go on it together?" 

"I will," I say. A happiness blooms inside of me, but I try to keep it hidden. 



"I'll see you in a little while, then." 



"Good luck with the tickets." 

She reaches over and grabs my hand and holds it for a good three seconds. Then she lets go, jumps off 
the swing, and hurries away. I sit there, gently swinging, enjoying the brisk wind that I haven't felt in a 

very long time because we spent the last winter in Florida, and the one before that in south Texas. 
When 

I head back to the pavilion Henri is sitting at a picnic table eating a slice of pie with Bernie Kosar lying at 
his feet. 

"How'd it go?" 

"Good," I say with a smile. 

From somewhere an orange and blue firework shoots up and explodes in the sky. It makes me think of 
Lorien and of the fireworks I saw on the day of the invasion. 

"Have you thought any more about the second ship I saw?" 

Henri looks around to make sure there's nobody within earshot. We have the picnic table to ourselves, 
positioned in the far corner away from the crowd. 

"A little. I still have no idea what it means, though." 



"Do you think it could have traveled here?" 

"No. It wouldn't be possible. If it ran on fuel, like you say, it wouldn't have been able to travel far 
without refueling. " 

I sit for a moment. 

"I wish it could have." 

"Could have what?" 

"Traveled here, with us." 

"It's a nice thought," says Henri. 



An hour or so passes and I see all the football players, Mark in front, walk across the grass. They are 

dressed up as mummies, zombies, ghosts, twenty-five of them in total. They sit in the bleachers of the 

nearest baseball field and the cheerleaders who were drawing on the children begin applying makeup to 

complete the costumes of Mark and his friends. It's only then that I realize the football players will be 
the 

ones doing the scaring on the haunted hayride, the ones waiting for us in the woods. 



"See that?" I ask Henri. 



Henri looks at them all and nods, then picks up his coffee and takes a long drink. 



"Think you should still go on the ride?" he asks. 
"No," I say. "But I'm going to anyway." 
"I figured you would." 

Mark is dressed as a zombie of sorts, wearing dark tattered clothes, with black and gray makeup on his 
face, splotches of red in random places to simulate blood. When his costume is complete Sarah walks up 
to him and says something. His voice becomes raised but I can't hear what he's saying. His movements 
are animated and he talks so fast that I can tell he's stumbling over his words. Sarah crosses her arms 
and shakes her head at him. His body tenses. I move to stand, but Henri grabs my arm. 

"Don't," he says. "He's only pushing her further away." 

I look at them and wish with everything that I could hear what is being said, but there are too many 

screaming kids around to focus in. When the yelling stops they both stand looking at each other, a 
hurtful 

scowl on Mark's face, an incredulous grin on Sarah's. Then she shakes her head and walks away. 



I look at Henri. "What should I do now?" 



"Not a thing," he says. "Not a thing." 

Mark walks back to his friends, head hung, scowling. A few of them look in my direction. Smirks 
appear. Then they start walking towards the forest. A slow methodical march, twenty-five guys in 
costume receding in the distance. 



To kill time I walk back to the center of town with Henri and we eat dinner at the Hungry Bear. When 

we walk back the sun has set and the first trailer piled with hay and pulled by a green tractor takes off 
for 

the woods. The crowd has thinned considerably and those left are mostly high schoolers and free- 
spirited 

adults who total a hundred or so people. I look for Sarah among them but I don't see her. The next 
trailer leaves in ten minutes. According to the pamphlet the whole ride is half an hour long, the tractor 
going through the woods slowly, the anticipation building, and then it stops and the riders are to get off 
and follow a different trail on foot, at which point the scares begin. 

Henri and I stand beneath the pavilion and I again scan the long line of people waiting their turn. I still 
don't see her. Just then my phone vibrates in my pocket. I can't remember the last time my phone rang 
when it wasn't Henri calling. The caller ID readsSARAH HART . Excitement rushes through me. She 
must have entered my number into her phone the same day she entered hers into mine. 



"Hello?" I say. 



"John?" 
"Yeah." 

"Hey, it's Sarah. Are you still at the park?" she says. She sounds as though her calling me is normal, that 
I shouldn't think twice about her already hav ing my number despite my never having given it to her. 

"Yes." 



"Great! I'm going to be back there in about five minutes. Have the rides started?" 



"Yeah, a couple minutes ago." 



"You haven't gone yet, have you?" 



"No." 



"Oh, good! Wait so we can ride together." 

"Yeah, definitely," I say. "The second one is about to leave now." 

"Perfect. I'll be there in time for the third." 

"See you then." 

I hang up, a huge smile on my face. 
"Be careful out there," Henri says. 

"I will." Then I pause and try to bring lightness to my voice. "You don't have to stick around. I'm sure I 
can get a ride home." 

"I'm willing to stay and live in this town, John. Even w hen it's probably smarter for us to leave given the 
events that have already happened. But you're going to have to meet me halfway on things. And this is 
one of them. I don't like the looks those guys gave you earlier one bit." 

I nod. Til be fine," I say. 

"I'm sure you will. But just in case I'm going to be right here waiting." 



I sigh. "Fine." 



Sarah pulls up five minutes later with a pretty friend who I've seen before but have never been 
introduced to. She has changed into jeans, a wool sweater, and a black jacket. She has wiped away the 
painted ghost that was on her right cheek and her hair is down, falling past her shoulders. 

"Hey, you," she says. 

"Hi." 

She wraps her arms around me in a tentative hug. I can smell the perfume wafting up from her neck. 
Then she pulls away. 

"Hi, John's dad," she says to Henri. "This is my friend Emily." 

"Pleased to meet you both," Henri says. "So you guys are off into the unknown terror?" 

"You bet," Sarah says. "Will this one be okay out there? I don't want him getting too scared on me," 
Sarah says to Henri, motioning to me with a smile. 



Henri grins and I can tell he already likes Sarah. "You better stay close just in case." 



She looks over her shoulder. The third trailer is a quarter full. "I'll keep him safe," she says. "We better 
get going." 

"Have a great time," Henri says. 

Sarah surprises me by taking my hand and the three of us rush off towards the hay wagon a hundred 
yards away from the pavilion. There is a line about thirty people long. We get to the back of it and start 
talking, though I'm feeling a little shy and mostly just listen to the two girls talk. As we're waiting I see 
Sam hovering off to the side as though contemplating whether or not to approach us. 

"Sam!" I yell with more enthusiasm than I intended. He stumbles over. "You coming on the ride with 
us?" 

He shrugs. "Do you mind?" 

"Come on," Sarah says, and motions him in. He stands next to Emily, who smiles at him. He immediately 
starts blushing and I'm ecstatic he's along for the ride. Suddenly a kid holding a walkie-talkie comes 
over. I recognize him from the football team. 

"Hi, Tommy," Sarah says to him. 

"Hey," he says. "There are four spots left on this wagon. You guys want them?" 



"Really?" 



"Yeah." 



We skip the line and jump up onto the trailer, where the four of us sit on a bale of hay together. I find it 
odd that Tommy doesn't ask us for tickets. I'm curious as to why he let us skip the line altogether. Some 
of the people waiting look at us with disgust. I can't say that I blame them. 

"Enjoy the ride," Tommy says with a grin, the kind I've seen people wear when told something bad has 
happened to someone they despise. 

"That was weird," I say. 

Sarah shrugs. "He probably has a crush on Emily." 
"Oh God, I hope not," Emily says, and then fake-gags. 

I watch Tommy from the bale of hay. The trailer is only half full, which is another thing that strikes me 
as 

strange since there are so many people waiting. 

The tractor pulls away, bumps along the pathway, and drives through the entrance of the forest, where 

ghastly sounds come through hidden speakers. The forest is thick and no light penetrates other than 
what 

shines from the front of the tractor.Once that is off, I think,there will be nothing but darkness . Sarah 
takes hold of my hand again. She's cold to the touch, but a sense of warmth floods through me. She 
leans over to me and whispers, "I'm a little scared." 



Figures of ghosts hang just over us from the low branches, and off the drive grimacing zombies lean 

against various trees. The tractor stops and kills its headlight. Then come intermittent strobes that flash 
for 

ten seconds. There is nothing scary about them and only when they stop do I understand their effect: 
our 

eyes take a few seconds to adjust and we can't see a thing. Then a scream shoots through the night and 
Sarah tenses against me as figures sweep around us. I squint to focus and I see that Emily has moved 
next to Sam, and that he is smiling widely. I'm actually a little scared myself. I put my arm carefully 
around Sarah. A hand grazes our backs and Sarah grips tightly to my leg. Some of the others scream. 
With a jolt the tractor turns back on and continues forward, nothing but the outlines of the trees in its 
light. 

We drive for another three or four minutes. The anticipation builds, the foreboding fear of having to 
walk 

the distance we just drove. Then the tractor pulls into a circular clearing and stops. 
"Everybody off," the driver yells. 

When the last person is off, the tractor pulls away. Its light recedes in the distance, then disappears, 
leaving nothing but the night and not a single sound other than what we make. 



"Shit," somebody says, and all of us laugh. 



In total there are eleven of us. A path of lights turns on, showing us the way, then turns off. I close my 
eyes to focus on the feel of Sarah's fingers interlocked with mine. 

"I have no idea why I do this every year," Emily says nervously, her arms wrapped around herself. 

The other people have started down the trail and we follow. The pathway of lights occasionally flickers 
on to keep us on our way. The others are far enough ahead that we can't see them. I can barely see the 
ground at my feet. Three or four screams suddenly ring out in front of us. 

"Oh no," Sarah says, and squeezes my hand. "Sounds like trouble ahead." 

Just then something heavy falls on us. Both girls scream and so does Sam. I trip and hit the ground, 
scraping my knee, tangled in whatever the hell the thing is. Then I realize it's a net! 

"What the hell?" Sam asks. 

I tear straight through the twisted rope but the second I'm free I get shoved hard from behind. Someone 

grabs me and drags me away from the girls and Sam. I break free and stand, but am immediately hit 
from 

behind again. This isn't part of the ride. 

"Let go of me!" one of the girls yells. A guy laughs in response. I can't see a thing. The girls' voices are 
moving away from me. 



"John?" Sarah calls. 



"Where are you, John?" shouts Sam. 

I stand to go after them but am hit again. No, that's not right. I am tackled. The wind is knocked out of 
me when I'm plowed to the ground. I rush up and try to catch my breath, my hand against a tree for 
support. I pick dirt and leaves from my mouth. 



I stand there a few seconds and don't hear a single sound other than my own labored breathing. Just 
when I think I've been left alone, somebody shoulders into me and sends me flying into a nearby tree. 
My head slams against the trunk and I briefly see stars. I'm surprised by the person's strength. I reach up 
and touch my forehead and feel blood on my fingertips. I look around again but can't see anything other 
than the silhouetted trees. 

I hear a scream from one of the girls, followed by the sounds of struggle. I grit my teeth. I am shaking. 
Are there people mixed in with the wall of trees around me? I can't tell. But I feel a set of eyes on me, 
somewhere. 



"Get off of me!" Sarah yells. She is being pulled away, I can tell that much. 

"Okay," I say to the darkness, to the trees. Anger surges through me. "You want to play games?" I say, 
loudly this time. Somebody laughs nearby. 

I take a step towards the sound. I get shoved from behind but I catch my balance before I fall. I throw a 
blind punch and the back of my hand scrapes against the bark of a tree. There is nothing left to do. What 
point is there in having Legacies if they are never used when needed? Even if it means Henri and I load 
the truck tonight and drive off to yet another town, at least I will have done what I needed to do. 

"You want to play games?" I yell again. "I can play games too!" 

A trickle of blood runs down the side of my face. Okay, I think, let's do this. They can do all they want 
to me, but they will not harm a single hair on Sarah's head. Or Sam's, or Emily's. 

I take a deep breath and adrenaline races through me. A malicious smile takes shape and my body feels 
as though it has grown bigger, stronger. My hands come on and glow brilliantly with bright light that 
sweeps through the night, the world suddenly ablaze. 

I look up. I flash my hands across the trees and sprint off into the night. 



CHAPTER FOURTEEN 



KEVIN STEPS FROM THE TREES, DRESSED AS Amummy. He's the one who tackled me. The 

lights stun him and he seems dumbfounded, trying to figure out where they're coming from. He's 
wearing 

night- vision goggles. So that is how they are able to see us , I think. Where did they get them? 
He charges me and at the last second I step out of the way and trip him. 

"Let go of me!" I hear from down the trail. I look up and sweep my lights across the trees but nothing 
moves. I can't tell if the v oice is Emily's or Sarah's. A guy's laughter follows. 

Kevin tries to stand but I kick him in the side before he gets to his feet. He falls back to the ground with 
an "Ummpf!" I rip the goggles from his face and throw them as far as I can and know they will land at 
least a mile away, maybe two or three because I'm so angry that my strength is out of control. Then I 
race off through the woods before Kevin can even sit up. 



The trail winds left, then right. My hands glow only when I need to see. I sense that I'm close. Then I 
see Sam up ahead, standing with a zombie's arms around him. Three others are close by. 



The zombie lets go of him. "Chill out, we're just kidding around. If you don't resist, you won't get hurt," 



he says to Sam. "Sit down or something." 



I snap my hands on and flash the lights in their eyes to blind them. The closest person steps towards me 
and I swing and hit him in the side of the face and he falls motionless to the ground. His goggles sail into 
the overgrown brambles and disappear. The second person tries to bear-hug me, but I break his grip and 
lift him off the ground. 

"What the hell?" he says, confused. 

I throw him and he hits the side of a tree twenty feet away. The third guy sees this and runs away. That 
just leaves the fourth, the one who was holding Sam. He lifts his hands in front of him as though I'm 
aiming a gun at his chest. 

"It wasn't my idea," he says. 
"What does he have planned?" 

"Nothing, man. We just wanted to play a joke on you guys, scare you a little." 
"Where are they?" 

"They let Emily go. Sarah is up ahead." 
"Give me your goggles," I say. 



"No way, man. We're borrowing them from the police. I'll get in trouble." 
I step towards him. 

"Fine," he says. He takes them off and hands them to me. I throw them ev en harder than I did the 
previous pair. I hope they land in the next town. Let them explain that one to the police. 

I grab Sam's shirt with my right hand. I can't see a thing without turning on my light. Only then do I 
realize I should have kept the two pairs of goggles for us to wear. But I didn't, so I take a deep breath 
and let my left hand glow and begin guiding us up the path. If Sam finds it suspicious, he doesn't let on. 

I stop to listen. Nothing. We continue on, weaving through the trees. I turn the light off. 
"Sarah!" I yell. 

I stop to listen and hear nothing but the wind blowing through the branches and Sam's heav y breathing. 
"How many people are with Mark?" I ask. 
"Five or so." 

"Do you know which way they went?" 



"I didn't see." 



We push on and I have no idea in which direction we are headed. From far off I hear the groan of the 

tractor motor. The fourth ride is starting. I feel frantic inside and want to sprint, but I know that Sam 
can't 

keep up. He's breathing heavily already and even I'm sweating despite the temperature being only 
forty-five degrees. Or maybe I'm mistaking blood for sweat. I can't tell. 

As we pass a thick tree with a knotted trunk I get tackled from behind. Sam yells as a fist hits me in the 

back of the head and I'm momentarily stunned, but then I pivot and grab the guy by the throat and 
shine 

the light in his face. He tries to peel my fingers away but it's useless. 
"What is Mark planning?" 
"Nothing," he says. 
"Wrong answer." 

I thrust him into the nearest tree five feet away, then I pick him up and lift him a foot off the ground 
with 

my hand again around his throat. His legs kick wildly, hitting me, but I tighten my muscles so that the 
kicks do no damage. 



"What is he planning to do?" 

I lower him until his feet touch solid ground, loosening my grip to allow him to speak. I sense Sam 
watching, drinking all of this in, but there is nothing I can do about it. 

"We just wanted to scare you guys," he gasps. 

"I swear I will break you in half if you don't tell me the truth." 

"He thinks that the others are dragging you two to Shepherd Falls. That's where he took Sarah. He 
wanted her to see him beat the crap out of you, and then he was going to let you go." 

"Lead me," I say. 

He shuffles forward and I turn my light off. Sam takes hold of my shirt and follows behind us. When we 
walk through a small clearing lit by the moonlight overhead I can see that he's looking at my hands. 

"They're gloves," I say. "Kevin Miller was wearing them. Some sort of Halloween prop." 

He nods but I can tell he's freaked out. We walk for nearly a minute until we hear the sound of running 
water just ahead of us. 

"Give me your goggles," I say to the guy leading us. 



He hesitates and I twist his arm. He writhes in pain and quickly rips them from his face. 



"Take them, take them," he yells. 



When I put them on the world turns to a shade of green. I push him hard and he falls to the ground. 



"Come on," I say to Sam, and we walk ahead, leaving the guy behind. 
Up ahead I see the group. I count eight guys, plus Sarah. 

"I can see them now. Do you want to wait here or come with me? It might get ugly." 

"I want to come," Sam says. I can tell he's scared, though I'm not sure if it's because of what he's seen 
me do or the football players ahead of us. 

I walk the rest of the way as silently as I can, Sam tiptoeing behind me. When we are just a few feet 
away a twig snaps beneath Sam's foot. 

"John?" Sarah asks. She's sitting on a large rock with her knees to her chest and her arms wrapped 



around them. She isn't wearing goggles and squints in our direction. 



"Yes," I say. "And Sam." 

She smiles. "Told you," she says, and I assume she's talking to Mark. 

The water I heard is nothing more than a small babbling bro ok. Mark steps forward. 

"Well, well, well," he says. 

"Shut up, Mark," I say. "Manure in my locker was one thing, but you've gone way too far with this 
one." 

"You think? It's eight on two." 

"Sam has nothing to do with this. You scared to face me alone?" I ask. "What are you expecting to 
happen? You've tried kidnapping two people. Do you really think they'll keep silent?" 

"Yeah, I do. When they see me whip your ass." 

"You're delusional," I say, then turn to the others. "For those of you who don't want to go into the 
water, I suggest you leave now. Mark is going in no matter what. He's lost his chance to barter." 

All of them snicker. One of them asks what "barter" means. 



"Now's your last chance," I say. 
Every one of them stands firm. 
"So be it," I say. 

A nervous excitement plants itself in the center of my chest. As I take one step forward Mark steps 

back and trips over his own feet, falling to the ground. Two of the guys come at me, both bigger than 
me. 

One swings but I duck his punch and send one of my own into his gut. He doubles over with his hands 
holding his stomach. I shove the second guy and his feet leave the ground. He lands with a thud five feet 
away and the momentum pushes him into the water. He comes up splashing. The others stand rooted, 
shocked. I sense Sam moving over toward Sarah. I grab hold of the first guy and drag him across the 



Generated by ABC Amber LIT Conv erter, http://www.processtext.com /abclit.html 



ground. His errant kicks slice through the air but hit nothing. When we are at the bank of the brook I lift 
him by the waistband of his jeans and throw him into the water. Another guy lunges at me. I merely 
sidestep him and he lands face-first in the brook. Three down, four to go. I wonder how much of this 
Sarah and Sam can see without goggles on. 

"You guys are making it too easy for me," I say. "Who's next?" 



The biggest of the group throws a punch that comes nowhere near hitting me, though I counter so 
swiftly 

that his elbow catches me in the face and the goggle strap snaps. The goggles fall to the ground. I can 
only see slight shadows now. I throw a punch and hit the guy in the jaw and he falls to the ground like a 
sack of potatoes. He looks lifeless, and I fear that I've hit him too hard. I rip his goggles from his face 
and put them on. 

"Any volunteers?" 

Two of them hold their hands up in front of them in surrender; the third stands with his mouth gaping 
open like an idiot. 

"That leaves you, Mark." 

Mark turns as though he intends to run, but I lunge forward and grab him before he can, pulling his arms 
up into a full nelson. He writhes in pain. 

"This ends right now, do you understand me?" 

I squeeze tighter and he grunts in pain. "Whatever you have against me, you drop it now. That includes 
Sam and Sarah. You understand?" 

My grip tightens. I fear that if I squeeze any tighter his shoulder will pop from its socket. 



"I said, do you understand me?" 



"Yes!" 



I drag him over to Sarah. Sam is sitting on the rock beside her now. 
"Apologize." 

"Come on, man. You've proven your point." 
I squeeze. 

"I'm sorry!" he yells. 

"Say it like you mean it." 

He takes a deep breath. "I'm sorry," he says. 

"You're an asshole, Mark!" Sarah says, and slaps him hard across the face. He tenses, but I'm holding 
him firmly and there isn't a thing he can do about it. 



I drag him to the water. The rest of the guys stand watching in shock. The guy I had knocked out is 
sitting up scratching his head as though trying to figure out what has happened. I breathe a sigh of relief 
that he isn't badly hurt. 

"You're not going to say a word to anybody about this, you understand me?" I say, my voice so low 
that only Mark can hear me. "Everything that has happened tonight, it dies here. I swear, if I hear one 
word about it in school next week this is nothing compared to what will happen to you. Do you 
understand me? Not a single word." 

"Do you really think I would say anything?" he asks. 

"You make sure you tell your friends the same. If they tell a single soul it will beyou that I come for." 
"We won't say anything," he says. 

I let go, put my foot on his butt, and push him face-first into the water. Sarah is standing at the rock with 
Sam beside her. She hugs me tightly when I get to her. 

"Do you know kung fu or something?" she asks. 

I laugh nerv ously. "Could you see much?" 

"Not a lot, but I could tell what was happening. I mean, have you been training in the mountains your 
whole life or what? I don't understand how you did that." 



"I was just scared something would happen to you, I guess. And yeah, there was the past twelve years 
of martial arts training high in the Himalayas." 

"You're amazing." Sarah laughs. "Let's get out of here." 

None of the guys say a word to us. After ten feet I realize I have no idea where I'm going so I give the 
goggles to Sarah to lead the way. 

"I can't friggin' believe that," Sarah says. "I mean, what an asshole. Wait till they try to explain it to the 
police. I'm not letting him get away with it." 

"Are you really going to the police? Mark's dad is the sheriff, after all," I say. 

"Why wouldn't I after that? It was bullshit. Mark's dad's job is to enforce law, ev en when his son 
breaks it." 

I shrug in the darkness. "I think they received their punishment." 

I bite my lip, terrified of the police getting involved. If they do I'll hav e to leave, no way around it. We'll 
be packed up and headed out of town within the hour of Henri knowing. I sigh. 

"Don't you think?" I ask. "I mean, they've already lost several of the night- vision goggles. They'll have 
to explain that. And that's not to mention the icy cold water." 



Sarah doesn't say anything. We walk in silence and I pray that she is debating the merits of letting it go.

Eventually the end of the woods comes into view. Light reaches in from the park. When I stop, Sarah 
and Sam both look at me. Sam has been silent the entire time and I'm hoping that it's because he 

couldn't really see what was happening, the dark for once serving as an unexpected ally, that maybe 
he's 

a little shaken up by everything. 

"It's up to you guys," I say, "but I'm all for just letting the matter die. I really don't want to have to talk 
to police about what happened." 

The light falls on Sarah's skeptical face. She shakes her head. 

"I think he's right," Sam says. "I don't want to have to sit and write a stupid statement for the next half 
hour. I'll be in deep crap; my mom thinks I went to bed an hour ago." 

"You live nearby?" I ask. 

He nods. "Yeah, and I gotta go before she checks my room. I'll see you guys around." 



Without another word, Sam hurries away. He's clearly rattled. He's probably nev er been in a fight and 
certainly never one where he was kidnapped and attacked in the woods. I'll try talking to him tomorrow. 
If he did see something he shouldn't have, I'll convince him his eyes were playing tricks on him. 

Sarah turns my face to hers and traces the line of my cut with her thumb, mov ing it very gently across 
my 

forehead. Then she traces both my brows, staring into my eyes. 
"Thank you for tonight. I knew you were going to come." 
I shrug. "I wasn't going to let him scare you. " 

She smiles and I can see her eyes glistening in the moonlight. She moves towards me and as I realize 
what's about to happen my breath catches in my throat. She presses her lips to mine and everything 
inside of me turns to rubber. It's a soft kiss, lingering. My first. Then she pulls away and her eyes take me 
in. I don't know what to say. A million different thoughts run through my head. My legs feel wobbly and 
I'm barely able to stay upright. 

"I knew you were special the first time I saw you," she says. 
"I felt the same with you." 

She reaches up and kisses me again, her hand lightly pressed to my cheek. For the first few seconds I'm 
lost in the feel of her lips on mine and in the idea that I'm with this beautiful girl. 

She pulls away and both of us smile at each other, saying nothing, staring into each other's eyes. 



"Well, I think we better go see if Emily is still here," Sarah says after about ten seconds. "Or else I'll be 
stranded." 

"I'm sure she is," I say. 

We hold hands on the walk to the pavilion. I can't stop thinking about our kisses. The fifth tractor chugs 

along the trail. The trailer is full and there's still a line ten or so people long waiting their turn. And after 

everything that happened in the woods, with Sarah's warm hand in mine, the smile doesn't leave my 
face. 



CHAPTER FIFTEEN 



THE FIRST SNOWFALL COMES TWO WEEKS LATER.A slight dusting, just enough to cover the 

truck with a fine powder. Since just after Halloween, once the Loric crystal spread the Lumen 
throughout 

my body, Henri has begun my real training. We'v e worked every day, without fail, through the cold 

weather and the rain and now the snow. Though he doesn't say it I believe he's impatient for me to be 

ready. It started with disconcerted looks, his brows crinkled while he chewed on his bottom lip, followed 

by deep sighs and eventually sleepless nights, the floorboards creaking under his feet while I lay awake 
in 



my room, to where we are now, an inherent desperation in Henri's strained voice. 

We stand in the backyard, ten feet apart, facing each other. 

"I'm not really in the mood today," I say. 

"I know you're not, but we have to anyway. " 

I sigh and look at my watch. It's four o'clock. 

"Sarah will be here at six," I say. 

"I know," Henri says. "That's why we must hurry." 

He holds a tennis ball in each hand. 

"Are you ready?" he asks. 

"As ready as I'll ever be." 

He throws the first ball high in the air, and as it reaches its apex, I try to conjure a power deep within 
me 

to keep it from falling. I don't know how I'm supposed to do it, only that I should beable to do it, with 
time and practice, says Henri. Each Garde develops the ability to move objects with their mind. 
Telekinesis. And instead of letting me discover it on my ownâ€” as I did my handsâ€”Henri seems hell-bent 
on waking the power from whatever cave it's hibernating in. 



The ball drops just as the thousand or so balls before it did, without a single interruption, bouncing 
twice, 

then lying motionless in the snow-covered grass. 
I let out a deep sigh. "I'm not feeling it today. " 
"Again," Henri says. 

He throws the second ball. I try to move it, to stop it, everything inside of me straining to just make the 
damn thing move a single inch to the right or left, but no luck. It hits the ground as well. Bernie Kosar, 
who has been watching us, walks out to it, picks it up, and walks away. 

"It'll come in its own time," I say. 



Henri shakes his head. The muscles in his jaw are flexed. His moods and impatience are getting to me. 
He watches Bernie Kosar trot off with the ball, then he sighs. 



"What?" I ask. 



He shakes his head again. "Let's keep trying." 

He walks over and picks up the other ball. Then he flings it high in the air. I try to stop it but of course it 
just falls. 

"Maybe tomorrow," I say. 

Henri nods and looks at the ground. "Maybe tomorrow." 



I am covered in sweat and mud and melted snow after our workout. Henri pushed me harder than 

normal today and came at me with an aggression that could only be steeped in panic. Beyond the 

telekinesis practice, most of our session was spent drilling technique in fightingâ€”hand-to-hand combat, 

wrestling, mixed martial artsâ€”followed by elements of composureâ€” grace under pressure, mind control, 

how to spot fear in the eyes of an opponent and then know how best to expose it. It wasn't Henri's hard 

training that got to me, but rather the look in his eyes. A distressed look, tinged with fear, despair, 

disappointment. I don't know if he's just concerned about progress, or if it's something deeper, but 
these 

sessions are becoming very exhaustingâ€” emotionally and physically. 



Sarah arrives right on time. I walk outside and kiss her as she's coming up to the front porch. I take her 
coat from her and hang it when we're inside. Our horn e-ec midterm is a week away, and it was her idea 
to cook the meal before we'll have to prepare it in class. As soon as we begin cooking Henri grabs his 



jacket and goes for a walk. He takes Bernie Kosar with him and I'm thankful for the privacy. We make 

baked chicken breasts and potatoes and steamed vegetables, and the meal comes out far better than I 

had hoped. When all is ready the three of us sit and eat together. Henri is silent through most of it. 
Sarah 

and I break the awkward silence with small talk, about school, about our going to the movies the 
following Saturday. Henri rarely looks up from his plate other than to offer how wonderful the meal is. 

When dinner is ov er Sarah and I wash the dishes and r etreat to the couch. Sarah brought a movie over 
and we watch it on our small TV, but Henri mostly stares out the window. Halfway throu gh he gets up 
with a sigh and walks outside. Sarah and I watch him go. We hold hands and she leans against me with 
her head on my shoulder. Bernie Kosar sits beside her with his head in her lap, a blanket draped over 
both of them. It may be cold and blustery outside, but it's warm and cozy in our living room. 

"Is your dad okay?" Sarah asks. 

"I don't know. He's been acting weird." 

"He was really quiet during dinner." 

"Yeah, I'm going to go check on him. I'll be right back," I say, and follow Henri outside. He's standing 
on the porchâ€”looking out into the darkness. 



"So what's going on?" I ask. 



He looks up at the stars in contemplation. 



"Something doesn't feel right," he says. 



"What do you mean?" 



"You're not going to like it." 



"Okay. Let's have it." 



"I don't know how much longer we should stay here. It doesn't feel safe to me." 



My heart sinks and I stay silent. 



"They're frantic, and I think they're getting close. I can feel it. I don't think we're safe here." 



"I don't want to leave." 



"I knew you wouldn't." 



"We've kept hidden." 



Henri looks at me with a raised brow. "No offense, John, but I hardly think you've stayed in the 
shadows." 

"I have where it counts." 
He nods. "I guess we'll see." 

He walks to the edge of the porch and places his hands on the rail. I stand beside him. New snowflakes 
start falling, sifting down, specks of white shimmering on an otherwise dark night. 

"That's not all," Henri says. 
"I didn't think it was." 

He sighs. "You should have already developed telekinesis. It almost always comes with your first 
Legacy. Very rarely does it come after, and when it does, it's never longer than a week later." 

I look over at him. His eyes are full of concern, and creases of worry traverse the length of his forehead. 

"Your Legacies come from Lorien. They always have." 

"So what are you telling me?" 

"I don't know how much we can expect from here on out," he says, and pauses. "Since we're no longer 



on the planet, I don't know if the rest of your Legacies will come at all. And if that is true, we have no 
hope of fighting the Mogadorians, much less defeating them. And if we can't defeat them, we'll never be 
able to go back." 



I watch the snowfall, unable to decide whether I should be worried or relieved, relieved since perhaps 
that would bring an end to our moving and we could finally settle. Henri points at the stars. 

"Right there," he says. "Right there is where Lorien is." 

Of course I know full well where Lorien is without having to be told. There is a certain pull, a certain 

way that my eyes always gravitate towards the spot where, billions of miles away, Lorien sits. I try to 

catch a snow-flake on the tip of my tongue, then close my eyes and breathe in the cold air. When I open 

them I turn around and look at Sarah through the window. She's sitting with her legs beneath her, 
Bernie 

Kosar's head still in her lap. 

"Have you ever thought of just settling here, of saying to hell with Lorien and making a life here on 
Earth?" I ask Henri. 

"We left when you were pretty young. I don't imagine you remember much of it, do you?" 



"Not really," I say. "Bits and pieces come to me from time to time. Though I can't necessarily say 
whether they are things I remember or things I've seen during our training." 

"I don't think you would feel that way if you could remember." 

"But I don't remember. Isn't that the point?" 

"Maybe," he says. "But whether or not you want to go back doesn't mean the Mogadorians are going 
to stop searching for you. And if we get careless and settle, you can be assured they'll find us. And as 
soon as they do, they'll kill us both. There's no way to change that. No way." 

I knows he's right. Somehow, like Henri, I can sense that much, can feel it in the dead of night when the 
hairs on my arms stand at attention, when a slight shiver crawls up my spine even though I'm not cold. 

"Do you ever regret sticking with me for this long?" 

"Regret it? Why do you think I would regret it?" 

"Because there's nothing for us to go back to. Your family is dead. So is mine. On Lorien there is only a 
life of rebuilding. If it wasn't for me you could easily create an identity here and spend the rest of your 
days becoming a part of someplace. You could have friends, maybe even fall in love again." 

Henri laughs. "I'm already in love. And I'll continue to be until the day that I die. I don't expect you to 
understand that. Lorien is different from Earth." 



I sigh with exasperation. "But still, you could be a part of somewhere." 



"I am a part of somewhere. I'm a part of Paradise, Ohio, right now, with you." 



I shake my head. "You know what I mean, Henri." 



"What is it that you think I'm missing?" 



"A life." 



"You are my life, kiddo. You and my memories are my only ties to the past. Without you I have nothing. 
That's the truth." 

Just then the door opens behind us. Bernie Kosar comes trotting out ahead of Sarah, who is standing in 
the doorway half in and half out. 

"Are you two really going to make me watch this movie all by my lonesome?" she asks. 



Henri smiles at her. "Wouldn't dream of it," he says. 



After the movie Henri and I drive Sarah home. When we get there I walk her to her front door and we 
stand on the stoop smiling at each other. I kiss her good night, a lingering kiss while holding both her 
hands gently in mine. 

"See you tomorrow," she says, giving my hands a squeeze. 
"Sweet dreams." 

I walk back to the truck. Henri pulls out of Sarah's driveway and steers towards home. I can't help 

feeling a sense of fear while remembering Henri's words the day he picked me up from my first full day 
of 

school: "Just keep in mind we might have to leave at a moment's notice." He's right, and I know it, but 
I've never felt this way about anyone before. Like I'm floating on air when we're together, and I dread 
the times when we're apart, like now, despite having just spent the last couple of hours with her. Sarah 
gives some purpose to our running, and hiding, a reason that transcends mere survival. A reason to win. 
And to know that I may be putting her life in danger by being with herâ€”well, it terrifies me. 

When we get back, Henri walks into his bedroom and comes out carrying the Chest. He drops it on the 
kitchen table. 



"Really?" I ask. 



He nods. "There's something in here I've wanted to show you for years." 

I can't wait to see what else is in the chest. We pop the lock together and he lifts the lid in such a way 
that I can't peer in. Henri removes a velvet bag, closes the Chest, and relocks it. 

"These aren't part of your Legacy, but the last time we opened the Chest I slipped them in because of 

the bad feeling I've been having. If the Mogadorians catch us, they'll never be able to open this," he 

says, 

and motions to the Chest. 
"So what's in the bag?" 
"The solar system," he says. 

"If they aren't part of my Legacy then why have you nev er shown me?" 
"Because you needed to develop a Legacy in order to activate them." 



He clears the kitchen table and then sits across from me with the bag in his lap. He smiles at me, 
sensing 



my enthusiasm. Then he reaches down and removes seven glass orbs of varying sizes from the bag. He 

holds them up to his face in his cupped hands and blows on the glass orbs. Tiny flickers of light come 

from within them, then he tosses them up in the air and all at once they come to life, suspended above 
the 

kitchen table. The glass balls are a replica of our solar system. The largest of them is the size of an 
orangeâ€” Lorien's sunâ€”and it hangs in the middle emitting the same amount of light as a lightbulb while 

looking like a self-contained sphere of lava. The other balls orbit around it. Those closest to the sun 
move 

at a faster rate, while those farthest away seem to only creep by. All of them spinning, days beginning 
and 

ending at hyperspeed. The fourth globe from the sun is Lorien. We watch it move, watch the surface of 
it 

begin to form. It is about the size of a racquetball. The replica must not be to scale because in reality 
Lorien is far smaller than our sun. 

"So what's happening?" I ask. 

"The ball is taking on the exact form of what Lorien looks like at this moment." 
"How is this even possible?" 

"It's a special place, John. An old magic exists at its very core. That's where your Legacies come from. 
It's what gives life and reality to the objects contained within your Inheritance." 

"But you just said that this isn't part of my Legacy." 



"No, but they come from the same place." 



Indentations form, mountains grow, deep creases cut across the surface where I know rivers once ran. 
And then it stops. I look for any sort of color, any movement, any wind that might blow across the land. 
But there is nothing. The entire landscape is a monochromatic patch of gray and black. I don't know 
what I had hoped to see, what I had expected. Movement of some kind, a hint of fertileness. My spirits 
fall. Then the surface dims away so that we can see through it and at the very core of the globe a slight 
glow begins to form. It glows, then dims, then glows again as though replicating the heartbeat of a 
sleeping animal. 

"What is that?" I ask. 

"The planet still lives and breathes. It has withdrawn deep into itself, biding its time. Hibernating, if you 
will. But it will wake one of these days." 

"What makes you so sure?" 

"That little glow right there," he says. "That is hope, John." 

I watch it. I find an odd pleasure in seeing it glow. They tried to wipe away our civilization, the planet 
itself, and yet it still breathes. Yes , I think,there is always hope, just as Henri has said all along . 

"That isn't all." 

Henri stands and snaps his fingers and the planets stop moving. He moves his face to within inches of 
Lorien, then cups his hands around his mouth and again breathes onto it. Hints of green and blue sweep 



across the ball and begin to fade almost immediately as the mist from Henri's breath evaporates. 



"What did you do?" 

"Flash your hands on it," he says. 

I make them glow and when I hold them over the ball the green and blue come back, only this time they 
stay as my hands shine upon it. 

"It's how Lorien looked the day before the invasion. Would you look how beautiful it all is? Sometimes 
even I forget." 

Itis beautiful. Everything green and blue, plush and verdant. The vegetation seems to waver beneath 
gusts of wind that I can somehow feel. Slight ripples appear on the water. The planet is trulyalive , 
flourishing. But then I turn my glow back off and it all fades away, back to shades of gray. 

Henri points at a spot on the globe's surface. 

"Right here," he says, "is where we took off from on the day of the invasion." Then he moves his finger 



half an inch from the spot. "And right here is where the Loric Museum of Exploration used to be." 
I nod and look at the spot he is pointing to. More gray. 

"What do museums have to do with anything?" I ask. I sit back in the chair. It's hard to look at this 
without feeling sad. 

He looks back at me. "I've been thinking a lot about what you saw." 
"Uh-huh," I say, urging him on. 

"It was a huge museum, devoted entirely to the evolution of space travel. One of the wings of the 
building held early rockets that were thousands of years old. Rockets that used to run on a kind of fuel 
known only to Lorien," he says, and stops, looking back to the small glass orb hanging two feet above 
our kitchen table. "Now, if what you saw did in fact happen, if a second ship managed to take off and 
escape from Lorien during the height of the war, then it would have to have been housed at the space 
museum. There's no other explanation for it. I'm still having a tough time believing that it would have 
worked, and even if it did, that it would have gotten v ery far. " 

"So if it wouldn't have gotten very far, then why are you still thinking about it?" 

Henri shakes his head. "You know, I'm not really sure. Maybe because I've been wrong before. Maybe 

because I'm hoping I am wrong now. And, well, if ithad made it anywhere, then it would have made it 

here, the closest life-sustaining planet aside from Mogadore. And that's to assume that there was life on 
it 

in the first place, that it wasn't just full of artifacts, or that it wasn't just empty, meant to confuse the 



Mogadorians. But I think there had to have been at least one Loric manning the ship because, well, as 
I'm sure you know, ships of that nature couldn't steer themselves." 



Another night of insomnia. I stand shirtless in front of the mirror, staring into it with both lights in my 
hands turned on. "I don't know how much we can expect from here on out," Henri said today. The light 
at Lorien's core still burns, and the objects we brought from there still work, so why would that magic 
have ended there? And what about the others: are they now running into the same problems? Are they 



without their Legacies? 

I flex in front of the mirror, then punch the air, hoping that the mirror will break, or a thud will be heard 
on the door. But there is nothing. Just me looking like an idiot standing shirtless, shadowboxing with 
myself while Bernie Kosar watches from the bed. It's nearly midnight and I'm not tired in the least. 
Bernie Kosar jumps off the bed, sits beside me, and watches my reflection. I smile at him and he wags 
his tail. 

"How about you?" I ask Bernie Kosar. "Do you hav e any special powers? Are you a superdog? Should 



I put your cape back on so you can go flying through the air?" 

His tail keeps wagging and he paws the ground while looking at me through the tops of his eyes. I lift 
him 

up and over my head and fly him around the room. 
"Look! It's Bernie Kosar, the magnificent superdog!" 

He squirms under my grip, so I set him down. He plops on his side with his tail thumping against the 
mattress. 

"Well, buddy, one of us should have superpowers. And it doesn't look like it's going to be me. Unless 
we go back to the Dark Ages and I can supply the world with light. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'm useless." 

Bernie Kosar rolls onto his back and stares at me with big eyes, wanting me to rub his belly. 



CHAPTER SIXTEEN 



SAM IS AVOIDING ME. AT SCHOOL HE SEEMS TOdisappear when he sees me, or always 
makes sure we're in a group. At the urging of Henriâ€”who's desperate to get his hands on Sam's 
magazine after combing through everything that came up on the internet and finding nothing like Sam's 
magazineâ€” I decide to just go over to his place unannounced. Henri drops me off after we've trained for 
the day. Sam liv es on the outskirts of Paradise in a small, modest house. There's no answer when I 



knock so I try the door. It's unlocked and I open it and walk through. 

Brown shag carpet covers the floors, and family photographs from when Sam was very young hang on 
wood-paneled walls. Him, his mother, and a man who I assume is his father, who is wearing glasses 
every bit as thick as Sam's. Then I look closer. They look like the exact same pair of glasses. 

I creep down the hallway until I find the door that must be to Sam's bedroom; a sign readingENTER AT 
YOUR OWN RISK hangs from a tack. The door is open a crack and I peer inside. The room is very 
clean, everything consciously put in a place. His twin bed is made, has a black comforter with the planet 
Saturn repeated across it. Matching pillowcases. The walls are covered with posters. There are two 
NASA ones, the movie poster fromAlien , a movie poster fromStar Wars , and one that is a blacklight 
poster of a green alien head surrounded by dark felt. In the center of the room, hanging from clear 
thread, is the solar system, all nine planets and the sun. It makes me think of what Henri showed me 
earlier in the week. I think that Sam would lose his mind if he were to see the same thing. And then I see 
Sam, hunched over a small oak desk, with headphones on. I push the door open and he looks ov er his 
shoulder. He isn't wearing his glasses, and without them his eyes look very small and beady, almost 
cartoonlike. 



"What's up?" I ask casually, as if I'm at his house every day. 



He looks shocked and scared and he frantically pulls the headphones off to reach in one of the drawers. 
I look at his desk and see that he's reading a copy ofThey Walk Among Us. When I look back up he is 
pointing a gun at me. 

"Whoa," I say, instinctively lifting my hands in front of me. "What's going on?" 

He stands up. His hands are shaking. The gun is pointed at my chest. I think that he's lost his mind. 

"Tell me what you are," he says. 

"What are you talking about?" 

"I saw what you did in those woods. You're not human." I was afraid of this, that he saw more than I 
had hoped. 

"This is crazy, Sam! I got into a fight. I've been doing martial arts for years." 

"Your hands lit up like flashlights. You could throw people around like they were nothing. That's not 
normal." 

"Don't be stupid," I say, my hands still in front of me. "Look at them. Do you see any lights? I told you, 
they were gloves that Kevin was wearing. " 

"I asked Kevin! He said he wasn't wearing gloves!" 



"Do you really think he would tell you the truth after what happened? Put the gun down." 
"Tell me! What are you?" 

I roll my eyes. "Yes, I'm an alien, Sam. I'm from a planet hundreds of millions of miles away. I have 
superpowers. Is that what you want to hear?" 

He stares at me, his hands still shaking. 

"Do you realize how stupid that sounds? Quit being crazy and put the gun down." 
"Is what you just said true?" 

"That you're being stupid? Yes, it's true. You're too obsessed with this stuff. You see aliens and alien 
conspiracies in every part of your life, including in your only friend. Now quit pointing that damn gun at 
me." 

He stares at me, and I can tell he's thinking about what I said. I drop my hands. Then he sighs and 
lowers the gun. "I'm sorry," he says. 

I take a deep, nervous breath. "You should be. What the hell were you thinking?" 
"It wasn't actually loaded." 



"You should have told me that earlier," I say. "Why do you want so badly to believe in this stuff?" 

He shakes his head and puts the gun back in the drawer. I take a minute to calm myself down and try to 
act casual, like what just happened is no big deal. 

"What are you reading?" I ask. 

He shrugs. "Just more alien stuff. Maybe I should cool it a bit." 

"Or just read it as fiction instead of fact," I say. "The stuff must be pretty convincing, though. Can I see 
it?" 

He hands me the latest copy ofThey Walk Among Us and I sit tentatively on the edge of his bed. I think 

he's calmed down enough to not spring a gun on me again at least. Again, it is a bad photocopy, the 
print 

slightly unaligned with the paper. It isn't very thickâ€”eight pages, twelve at the most, printed on 
legal-sized sheets. The date at the top readsDECEMBER . It must be the newest issue. 



"This is weird stuff, Sam Goode," I say. 



He smiles. "Weird people like weird stuff." 
"Where do you get this?" I ask. 
"I subscribe to it." 
"I know, but how?" 

Sam shrugs. "I don't know. It just started arriving one day." 

"Are you subscribed to some other magazine? Perhaps they pulled your contact info from there." 

"I went to a convention once. I think I signed up for some contest or something while I was there. I can't 
remember. I've always assumed that's where they got my address." 

I scan the cover. There's no website listed anywhere on it, and I didn't expect there to be, considering 
that Henri has already searched the internet high and low. I read the headline of the top story: 



IS YOUR NEIGHBOR AN ALIEN? 
TEN FAILSAFE WAYS TO TELL! 



In the middle of the article there's a picture of a man holding a bag of trash in one hand and the lid to 
the 

trash can in the other. He is standing at the end of the driveway and we're to assume he's in the process 
of dropping the bag into the can. Though the whole publication is in black-and-white, there is a certain 
glow to the man's eyes. It's a horrible imageâ€”as though somebody took a picture of an unsuspecting 
neighbor and then drew around his eyes with a crayon. It makes me laugh. 



"What?" Sam asks. 

"This is a terrible picture. It looks like something fromGodzilla ." 

Sam looks at it. Then he shrugs. "I dunno," he says. "It could be real. Like you said, I see aliens 
everywhere, and in everything. " 

"But I thought aliens looked like that," I say, and nod to the blacklight poster on his wall. 

"I don't think all of them do," he says. "Like you said, you're an alien with superpowers and you don't 
look like that." 



We both laugh, and I wonder how I'm going to get myself out of that one. Hopefully Sam never finds 
out I was telling him the truth. Part of me wants to tell him, thoughâ€”about me, about Henri, about 
Lorienâ€” and I wonder what his reaction would be. Would he believe me? 

I flip the paper open to look for the publishing page that all newspapers and magazines have. There isn't 
one here, only more stories and theories. 

"There isn't a publisher info page." 

"What do you mean?" 

"You know how magazines and newspapers always have that page listing staff, editors, writers, where 
it's being printed, and all that? You know , v For questions, contact so and so.' All publications have them, 
but this doesn't." 

"They have to protect their anonymity," Sam says. 
"From what?" 

"Aliens," he says, and smiles, as though acknowledging the absu rdity of it. 
"Do you have last month's issue?" 

He grabs it from his closet. I quickly flip through it, hoping that the Mogadorian article is in this one and 
not an earlier month. And then I find it on page 4. 



THE MOGADORIAN RACE SEEK TO TAKE OVER EARTH 



The Mogadorian alien race, from the planet Mogadore of the 9th Galaxy, have been on Earth for over 
ten years now. They are a vicious race on a quest for universal domination. They are rumored to have 
wiped out another planet not unlike Earth, and are planning to expose Earth's weaknesses in a quest to 
inhabit our planet next. 

(more to follow next issue) 

I read the article three times. I was hoping there might be more to it than what Sam already said, but no 
such luck. And there is no Ninth Galaxy. I wonder where they got that from. I flip through the new issue 
twice. There is no mention of the Mogadorians. My first thought is that there was nothing left to report, 



that more news failed to present itself. But I don't believe that's the case. My second thought is that the 
Mogadorians read the issue and then fixed the problem, whatever the problem was. 

"Do you mind if I borrow this?" I ask, holding up last month's issue. 



He nods. "But be careful with it." 



Three hours later, at eight o'clock, Sam's mother still isn't home. I ask Sam where she is and he shrugs 
as though he doesn't know and her absence is nothing new. Mostly we just play v ideo games and watch 
TV and for dinner we eat microwavable meals. The whole time I'm there he doesn't once wear his 
glasses, which is odd since I've never seen him without them before. Even when we ran the mile in gym 
class, he kept them on. I grab them from the top of his dresser and put them on. The world becomes an 
instant blur and they give me a headache almost immediately. 

I look at Sam. He's sitting cross-legged on the floor, his back against his bed, with a book of aliens in 
his lap. 

"Jesus, is your vision really this bad?" I ask. 
He looks up at me. "They were my dad's." 
I take them off. 

"Do you even need glasses, Sam?" 
He shrugs. "Not really." 
"So why do you wear them?" 



"They were my dad's." 

I put them back on. "Wow, I don't see how you can even walk straight with these on." 
"My eyes are used to them." 

"You know these will screw up your vision if you continue wearing them, right?" 
"Then I'll be able to see what my dad saw." 

I take them off and put them back where I found them. I don't really understand why Sam wears them. 
For sentimental reasons? Does he really think it's worth it? 

"Where is your dad, Sam?" 

He looks up at me. 

"I don't know," he says. 

"What do you mean?" 



"He disappeared when I was seven." 



"You don't know where he went?" 



He sighs, drops his head, and resumes reading. Obviously he doesn't want to talk about it. 



"Do you believ e in any of this stuff?" he asks after a few minutes of silence. 



"Aliens?" 



"Yeah." 



"Yes, I believe in aliens." 



"Do you think they really abduct people?" 



"I have no idea. I guess we can't rule it out. Do you believe they do?" 



He nods. "Most days. But sometimes the idea just seems stupid." 



"I can understand that." 



He looks up at me. "I think my dad was abducted," he says. 



He tenses the second the words leave his mouth and a look of vulnerability crosses his face. It makes me 
believe that he has shared his theory before, with someone whose response was less than kind. 

"Why do you think that?" 

"Because he just disappeared. He went to the store to buy milk and bread, and he never came back. 
His truck was parked right outside the store but nobody there had seen him. He just vanished, and his 
glasses were on the sidewalk beside his truck." He pauses for a second. "I was worried you were here 
to abduct me." 

It's a hard theory to believe. How could nobody have seen his father abducted if the incident occurred 
in 

the middle of town? Perhaps his dad had reason to leave and he plotted his own disappearance. It's not 

hard to make yourself disappear; Henri and I have been doing it for ten years now. But all of a sudden 

Sam's interest in aliens makes perfect sense. Perhaps Sam just wants to see the world as his dad did, but 

maybe part of him truly believes that his dad's final sight is captured in the glasses, somehow etched 
into 

the lenses. Maybe he thinks that with persistence one day he'll eventually come to see it as well, and 
that 

his dad's last vision will confirm what is already in his head. Or maybe he believes that if he searches 
long 

enough he'll finally come across an article that proves his father was abducted, and not only th at, but 
that 

he can be saved. 



And who am I to say that he won't one day find that proof? 

"I believe you," I say. "I think alien abductions are very possible." 



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 

THE NEXT DAY I WAKE EARLIER THAN NORMAL,crawl out of bed, and walk out of my room 
to find Henri sitting at the table scanning the papers with his laptop open. The sun is still hidden, and the 
house is dark, the only light coming from his computer screen. 

"Anything?" 

"Nah, nothing really." 

I turn on the kitchen light. Bernie Kosar paws at the front door. I open it and he shoots out into the yard 
and patrols as he does every morning, head up, trotting around the perimeter looking for anything 
suspicious. He sniffs at random places. Once satisfied that everything is as it should be, he bolts into the 
woods and disappears. 



Two issues ofThey Walk Among Us are lying atop the kitchen table, the original and a photocopy that 
Henri has made to keep for himself. A magnifying glass lies between them. 

"Anything unique on the original?" 

"No." 

"So, now what?" I ask. 

"Well, I have had some luck. I cross-referenced some of the other articles in the issue and got a few hits, 
one of which led me to a man's personal website. I sent him an email." 

I stare at Henri. 

"Don't worry," he says. "They can't track emails. At least not the way I send them." 
"How do you send them?" 

"I reroute them through various serv ers in cities across the world, so that the original location is lost 
along the way." 

"Impressive." 

Bernie Kosar scratches at the door and I let him in. The clock on the microwave reads 5:59. 1 have two 
hours before I have to be at school. 



"Do you really think we want to go digging around in all this?" I ask. "I mean, what if it's all a trap? 
What if they are simply trying to root us out of hiding?" 

Henri nods. "You know, if the article had mentioned anything about us, that might have given me 
pause. 

But it didn't. It was about their invading Earth, much the same way they did Lorien. There is so much 
about it that we don't understand. You were right a few weeks ago when you said we were defeated so 
easily. We were. It doesn't make sense. The entire situation with the disappearance of the Elders also 
doesn't make sense. Even getting you and the other children off of Lorien, which I have never 
questioned, seems odd. And while you've seen what happenedâ€”and I've had the same visions, 



tooâ€”something is still missing from the equation. If we one day make it back, I think it's imperative to 
understand what happened in order to prev ent it from happening again. You know the saying: he who 
doesn't understand history is doomed to repeat it. And when it's repeated, the stakes are doubled." 

"Okay," I say. "But according to what you said Saturday night, the chance of us going back seems 
slimmer every day. So, with that, do you think it's worth it?" 

Henri shrugs. "There are still five others out there. Perhaps they've received their Legacies. Perhaps 



yours are merely delayed. I think it's best to plan for all possibilities." 
"Well, what are you planning to do?" 

"Just make a phone call. I'm curious to hear what this person knows. I wonder what caused him to not 
follow up. One of two possibilities: either he found no other information and lost interest in the story, or 
somebody got to him after the publication." 

I sigh. "Well, be careful," I say. 



I pull on a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt over two T-shirts, tie my tennis shoes and stand and 
stretch. I toss into my backpack the clothes I plan to wear to school, along with a towel, a bar of soap 
and a small bottle of shampoo so I can shower when I get there. I'll now be running to school each 
morning. Henri ostensibly believes the additional exercise will help in my training, but the real reason is 
that he hopes it will help my body's transition and pull my Legacies from their slumber, if that is indeed 
what they are doing. 

I look down at Bernie Kosar. "Ready for a run, boy? Huh? Want to go for a run?" 
His tail wags and he turns in circles. 
"See you after school." 



"Have a good run," says Henri. "Be careful on the road." 

We walk out the door and cold, brisk air meets us. Bernie Kosar barks excitedly a few times. I start at a 
slight jog, down the drive, out onto the gravel road, the dog trotting beside me as I thought he would. It 
takes a quarter mile to warm up. 

"Ready to step it up a notch, boy?" 

He pays me no attention, just keeps trotting along with his tongue dangling, looking happy as can be. 
"All right then, here we go." 

I kick it into high gear, moving into a run, and then into a dead sprint shortly after, going as fast as I can. 
I leave Bernie Kosar in the dust. I look behind me and he is running as fast as he can, yet I am pulling 
ahead of him. The wind through my hair, the trees passing in a blur. It all feels great. Then Bernie Kosar 
bolts into the woods and disappears from sight. I'm not sure if I should stop and wait for him. Then I turn 
around and Bernie Kosar jumps out of the woods ten feet in front of me.

I look down at him and he looks up at me, tongue to the side, a sense of glee in his eyes. 



"You're an odd dog, you know that?" 

After five minutes the school comes into view. I sprint the remaining half mile, exerting myself, running 
as 

hard as I can because it is so early that there is no one out and about to see me. Then I stand with my 

fingers interlocked behind my head, catching my breath. Bernie Kosar arrives thirty seconds later and 
sits 

watching me. I kneel down and pet him. 

"Good job, buddy. I think we have a new morning ritual." 

I pull my bag from over my shoulders, unzip it, and remove a package with a few strips of bacon and I 
give them to him. He scarfs them down. 

"Okay, boy, I'm heading in. Go on home. Henri's waiting." 

He watches me for a second, and then goes off trotting towards home. His comprehension completely 
amazes me. Then I turn and walk into the building and head for the shower. 



I am the second person to enter astronomy. Sam is the first, already sitting in his normal seat at the back 
of the class. 

"Whoa," I say. "No glasses. What gives?" 



He shrugs. "I thought about what you said. It's probably stupid for me to wear them." 

I sit beside him and smile. It's hard to imagine I'll ever get used to his eyes looking so beady. I give him 
back the issue ofThey Walk Among Us . He tucks it into his bag. I hold up my fingers like a gun and 
nudge him. 

"Bang!" I say. 

He starts laughing. Then I do, too. Neither of us can stop. Every time one of us is close the other starts 
laughing and it begins all over again. People stare at us when they enter. Then comes Sarah. She walks in 
by herself, saunters up to us with a look of confusion and sits in the seat beside me. 

"What are you guys laughing at?" 

"I'm not really sure," I say, and then laugh a little more. 

Mark is the last person to walk in. He sits in his usual seat, but instead of Sarah sitting beside him today 
there's another girl. I think she's a senior. Sarah reaches beneath the table and grabs hold of my hand. 

"There is something I need to talk to you about," she says. 

"What?" 

"I know it's last-minute, but my parents want to have you and your dad ov er for Thanksgiving dinner 



tomorrow. " 



"Wow. That would be awesome. I have to ask, but I know we don't have plans, so I assume the 
answer is yes." 



She smiles. "Great." 



"Since it's just the two of us, we don't usually even do Thanksgiving. 



"Well, we really go all out. And my brothers will both be home from college. They want to meet you." 



"How do they know about me?" 



"How do you think?" 



The teacher walks in and Sarah winks, then we both start taking notes. 



Henri is waiting for me as usual, Bernie Kosar propped up on the passenger seat with his tail wagging, 
thumping the side of the door the second he sees me. I slide in. 

"Athens," says Henri. 

"Athens?" 

"Athens, Ohio." 

"Why?" 

"That's where the issues ofThey Walk Among Us are being written, and printed. It's where they are 
being mailed." 

"How did you find that out?" 

"I have my ways." 

I look at him. 

"Okay, okay. It took three emails and five phone calls, but now I have the number." He looks over at 
me. "That is to say, it wasn't all that hard to find with a little effort." 

I nod. I know what he is telling me. The Mogadorians would have found it just as easily as he did. 
Which means, of course, that the scale now tips in fav or of Henri's second possibility â€”that somebody 



got to the publisher before the story further developed. 



"How far away is Athens?" 



"Two hours by car. " 



"Are you going?" 



"I hope not. I'm going to call first." 

When we get home Henri immediately picks up the phone and sits at the kitchen table. I sit down 
across 

from him and listen. 

"Yes, I'm calling to inquire about an article in last month's issue ofThey Walk Among Us." 
A deep voice responds on the other end. I can't hear what is said. 
Henri smiles. "Yes," he says, then pauses. 



"No, I'm not a subscriber. But a friend of mine is." 
Another pause. "No, thank you." 
He nods his head. 

"Well, I'm curious about the article written on the Mogadorians. There was never a follow-up in this 
month's issue as expected." 

I lean in and strain to hear, my body tense and rigid. When the reply comes the voice sounds shaken, 
disturbed. Then the phone goes dead. 

"Hello?" 

Henri pulls the phone away from his ear, looks at it, then brings it back in. 
"Hello?" he says again. 

Then he closes the phone and sets it on the table. He looks at me. 
"He said, v Don't call here again.' Then he hung up on me." 



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 



AFTER DEBATING IT FOR SEVERAL HOURS,Henri wakes up the next morning and prints 
door-to-door directions from here to Athens, Ohio. He tells me he'll be home early enough so we can go 

to Thanksgiving dinner at Sarah's house, and he hands me a slip of paper with the address and the 
phone 

number of where he's going. 

"Are you sure this is worth it?" I ask. 

"We have to figure out what's going on." 

I sigh. "I think we both know what is going on. " 

"Maybe," he says, but with full authority and none of the uncertainty usually accompanying the word. 



"You do realize what you would tell me if the roles were reversed, right?" 



Henri smiles. "Yes, John. I know what I would say. But I think this will help us. I want to find out what 
they have done to scare this man so badly. I want to know if they have mentioned us, if they are 



searching for us by means that we haven't yet thought of. It will help us to stay hidden, stay ahead of 
them. And if this man has seen them, we'll learn what they look like." 

"We already know what they look like." 

"We knew what they looked like when they attacked, over ten years ago, but they might have changed. 
They've been on Earth a long time now. I want to know how they're blending in." 

"Even if we know what they look like, by the time we see them on the street, it's probably going to be 
too late." 

"Maybe, maybe not. I see one, I'm going to try and kill it. There's no guarantee it's going to be able to 
kill me," he says, this time with the uncertainty and none of the authority. 

I give up. I don't like a single thing about him driving to Athens while I sit around at home. But I know 
my objections will continue to fall on deaf ears. 

"You sure you'll be back on time?" I ask. 

"I'm leaving now, which puts me there about nine. I doubt I'll stay more than an hour, two at the most. I 
should be back by one." 

"So why do I have this?" I ask, and hold up the slip of paper with the address and phone number. 
He shrugs. "Well, you never know." 



"Which is precisely why I don't think you should go." 

"Touch ," he says, bringing an end to the discussion. He gathers his papers, stands from the table, and 
pushes in the chair. 

"I'll see you this afternoon." 

"Okay," I say. 

He walks out to the truck and gets inside. Bernie Kosar and I walk out to the front porch and watch him 
drive away. I don't know why, but I have a bad feeling. I hope he makes it back. 



It's a long day. One of those days where time slows down and every minute seems like ten, every hour 
seems like twenty. I play video games and surf the internet. I look for news that might be related to one 
of the other children. I don't find anything, which makes me happy. That means we're staying under the 
radar. Avoiding our enemies. 

I periodically check my phone. I send a text message to Henri at noon. He doesn't reply. I eat lunch and 
feed Bernie, and then I send another. No reply. A nervous, unsettled feeling creeps in. Henri has never 



failed to text back immediately. Maybe his phone is off. Maybe his battery has died. I try to convince 
myself of these possibilities, but I know that neither of them is true. 

At two o'clock I start to get worried. Really worried. We're supposed to be at the Harts' in an hour. 
Henri knows the dinner is important to me. And he wo uld never blow it off. I get in the shower with the 

hope that by the time I get out, Henri will be sitting at our kitchen table drinking a cup of coffee. I turn 
the 

hot water all the way up and don't bother with the cold at all. I don't feel a thing. My entire body is now 
impervious to heat. It feels like lukewarm water is streaming over my skin, and I actually miss the feeling 
of heat. I used to love taking hot showers. Standing under the water for as long as it lasted. Closing my 
eyes and enjoying the water hitting my head and running down. It took me away from my life. It let me 
forget about who and what I am for a little while. 

When I get out of the shower, I open my closet and look for the nicest clothes I have, which are nothing 
special: khakis, a button-down shirt, a sweater. Because we live our life on the run, all I have are running 
shoes, which is so ridiculous it makes me laughâ€”the first time I've laughed all day. I go to Henri's room 
and look in his closet. He has a pair of loafers that fit me. Seeing all his clothes makes me more worried, 
more upset. I want to believe he's just taking longer than he should, but he would have contacted me. 
Something has to be wrong. 

I walk to the front door, where Bernie is sitting, staring out the window. He looks up at me and whines. I 
pat him on the head and go back to my room. I look at the clock. It's just after three. I check my phone. 



No messages, no texts. I decide to go to Sarah's and if I don't hear from Henri by five, I'll figure out a 
plan then. Maybe I'll tell them Henri is sick and that I'm not feeling well either. Maybe I'll tell them 
Henri's truck broke down and I need to go help him. Hopefully he shows up and we can just have a nice 
Thanksgiving dinner. It will actually be the first one we've ever had. If not, I'll tell them something. I'll 
have to. 

Without the truck I decide I'll run. I probably won't ev en break a sweat, and I will be able to get there 
faster than I would in the truck. And because of the holiday, the roads should be empty. I say good-bye 
to Bernie, tell him I'll be home later, and take off. I run on the edges of the fields, through woods. It feels 
good to burn some energy. It takes the edge off my anxiety. A couple times I get up near full speed, 
which is probably somewhere around sixty or seventy miles per hour. The cold air feels amazing 
whipping across my face. The sound of it is great, the same sound I hear when I stick my head out the 
window of the truck as we're driving down a highway. I wonder how fast I'll be able to run when I'm 
twenty, or twenty-five. 

I stop running about a hundred yards from Sarah's house. I'm not short of breath at all. As I walk up the 
driveway I see Sarah peek out the window. She smiles and waves, opening the front door just as I step 
onto her porch. 

"Hey, handsome," she says. 

I turn and look over my shoulder to pretend she's talking to somebody else. Then I turn back around 
and ask her if she's talking to me. She laughs. 

"You're silly," she says, and punches me in the arm before pulling me close to give me a lingering kiss. I 



take a deep breath and can smell the food: turkey and stuffing, sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts, 
pumpkin pie. 



"Smells great," I say. 



"My mom has been cooking all day." 
"Can't wait to eat." 
"Where is your dad?" 

"He got held up. He should be here in a little while." 

"Is he okay?" 

"Yeah, it's not a big deal." 

We go inside and she takes me on a tour. It's a great house. A classic family home with bedrooms on 
the second floor, an attic where one of her brothers has his room, and all of the living spaces â€”the living 



room, dining room, kitchen and family roomâ€”on the first floor. When we get to her room, she closes the 
door and kisses me. I'm surprised, but thrilled. 

"I've been looking forward to doing that all day," she says softly when she pulls away. As she walks 
towards the door, I pull her back to me and kiss her again. 

"And I'm looking forward to kissing you again later," I whisper. She smiles and punches me on the arm 
again. 

We head back downstairs and she takes me to the family room, where her two older brothers, home 

from college for the weekend, are watching football with her father. I sit with them, while Sarah goes to 

the kitchen to help her mother and her younger sister with dinner. I've never been that into football. I 

guess, because of the way Henri and I have lived, I've never really gotten into anything outside of our 
life. 

My concerns were always with trying to fit into wherever we were, and then getting ready to go 

somewhere else. Her brothers, and her father, all played football in high school. They love it. And in 

today's game, one of her brothers and her father like one of the teams, while her other brother likes the 

other team. They argue with each other, taunt each other, cheer and groan depending on what's 

happening in the game. They've clearly been doing this for years, probably for their entire lives, and 

they're clearly having a great time. It makes me wish Henri and I had something, besides my training and 

our endless running and hiding, that we were both into and that we could enjoy with each other. It 
makes 

me wish I had a real father and brothers to hang out with. 

At halftime Sarah's mother calls us in for dinner. I check my phone and still nothing. Before we sit down 
I go to the bathroom and try to call Henri and it goes straight to voice mail. It's almo st five o'clock, and 



I'm starting to panic. I come back to the table, where everyone is sitting. The table looks amazing. There 
are flowers in the center, with place mats and table settings meticulously placed in front of each of the 
chairs. Serving dishes of food are spread around the inside of the table, with the turkey sitting in front of 
Mr. Hart's place. Just after I sit down, Mrs. Hart comes into the room. She has taken off her apron and 
is wearing a beautiful skirt and sweater. 

"Have you heard from your dad?" she says. 

"I just tried calling him. He, uh, is running late and asked us not to wait. He's very sorry for the 
inconv enience," I say. 

Mr. Hart starts carving the turkey. Sarah smiles at me from across the table, which makes me feel better 
for about half a second. The food starts being passed, and I take small portions of everything. I don't 



think I'm going to be able to eat very much. I keep my phone out and on my lap, and have it set to 

vibrate if a call or text comes through. With each passing second, however, I don't believe anything is 

going to come through, or that I will ever see Henri again. The idea of living by myself â€”with my Legacies 

developing, and without anyone to explain them to me or train me, of running on my own, of hiding on 
my 

own, of finding my own way, of fighting the Mogadorians, fighting them until they are defeated or I am 



deadâ€”terrifies me. 



Dinner takes forever. Time is moving slowly again. Sarah's whole family peppers me with questions. I've 

never been in a situation where IV e been asked so many things by so many people in such a short 
period 

of time. They ask about my past, the places I've lived, about Henri, about my mother â€”who, I say as I 

always do, died when I was very young. It's the only answer I give that has even the smallest sliver of 

truth. I have no idea if my answers even make sense. The phone on my leg feels like it weighs a 
thousand 

pounds. It doesn't vibrate. It just sits there. 

After dinner, and before dessert, Sarah asks everyone to go out to the backyard so she can take some 
pictures. As we go outside, Sarah asks if something is wrong. I tell her I'm worried about Henri. She 
tries to calm me down and tell me everything is fine, but it doesn't work. If anything, it makes me feel 
worse. I try to imagine where he is and what he's doing, and the only image I can bring is him standing 
before a Mogadorian, looking terrified, and knowing he's about to die. 

As we gather for the pictures, I star t to panic. How could I get to Athens? I could run, but it might be 

hard to find my way, especially because I would have to avoid traffic and stay off the major highways. I 

could take a bus, but it would take too long. I could ask Sarah, but that would involve a huge amount of 

explaining, including telling her I was an alien and that I believed Henri had been either captured or 
killed 

by hostile aliens who were searching for me so that they could kill me. Not the best idea. 

As we pose I get a desperate urge to leave, but I need to do it in a way that doesn't make Sarah or her 

family mad at me. I focus on the camera, staring directly into it while trying to think of an excuse that 
will 



get the least amount of questions. I'm wracked with full-on panic now. My hands begin to shake. They 
feel hot. I look down at them to make sure they aren't glowing. They're not, but when I look back up I 
see that the whole camera is shaking in Sarah's hands. I know that somehow I'm doing it, but I have no 
idea how or what I can do to make it stop. A chill shoots up my back. My breath catches in my throat 
and at the same time the glass lens of the camera cracks and shatters. Sarah screams, then pulls the 
camera down and stares at it in confusion. Her mouth drops open and tears well up in her eyes. 

Her parents rush over to her to see if she's okay. I just stand there in shock. I'm not sure what to do. 

I'm bummed about her camera, and that she's upset about it, but I'm also thrilled because my 
telekinesis 

has clearly arrived. Will I be able to control it? Henri will be beside himself when he finds out. Henri. The 
panic returns. I clench my hands into fists. I need to get out of here. I need to find him. If the 
Mogadorians have him, which I hope they don't, I'll kill every damn one of them to get him back. 

Thinking quickly, I walk over to Sarah and pull her away from her parents, who are examining the 
camera to figure out what has just happened. 

"I just got a message from Henri. I'm really sorry, but I need to go." 

She's clearly distracted, glancing from me to her parents. 

"Is he all right?" 

"Yes, but I have to goâ€”he needs me." She nods and we kiss gently. I hope it's not for the last time. 



I thank her parents and her brothers and sister and I leave before they can ask me too many questions. I 

walk through the house and as soon as I'm out the front door, I start running. I take the same route 
home 

that I took to get to Sarah's house earlier. I stay off the main roads, run through the trees. I'm back in a 
few minutes. I hear Bernie Kosar scratching at the door as I sprint up the drive. He's clearly anxious, as 
though he also senses something amiss. 

I go straight to my room. I retrieve from my bag the piece of paper containing the phone number and 
address Henri gave me before leaving. I dial the number. A recording comes on. "I'm sorry, the number 
you are trying to reach has been disconnected or is no longer in service." I look down at the piece of 
paper and try the number again. The same recording. 

"Shit!" I yell. I kick a chair and it sails across the kitchen and into the living room. 

I walk into my room. I walk out. I walk back in again. I stare in the mirror. My eyes are red; tears have 

surfaced but none are falling. Hands shaking. Anger and rage and a terrible fear that Henri is dead 

consume me. I squeeze my eyes shut and squeeze all the rage into the pit of my stomach. In a sudden 

burst I scream and open my eyes and thrust my hands towards the mirror and the glass shatters though 
I 

am ten feet away. I stand looking at it. Most of the mirror is still attached to the wall. What happened at 
Sarah's was no fluke. 



I look at the shards on the floor. I reach a hand out in front of me and while concentrating on one 
particular shard, I try to move it. My breathing is contr oiled, but all the fear and anger remain within me. 
Fear is too simple a word. Terror. That is what I feel. 

The shard doesn't move at first, but then after fifteen seconds it begins to shake. Slowly at first, then 

rapidly. And then I remember. Henri said that it's usually emotions that trigger Legacies. Surely that is 

what is happening now. I strain to lift the shard. Beads of sweat stand out on my forehead. I concentrate 

with everything that I have and everything that I am despite all that is going on. It's a struggle to 
breathe. 

Ever so slowly the shard begins to rise. One inch. Two inches. It is a foot above the floor, continuing up, 

my right arm extended and moving with it until the shard of glass is at eye level. I hold it there. If only 

Henri could see this, I think. And in a flash, through the excitement of my newly discovered happiness, 

panic and fear return. I look at the shard, at the way it reflects the wood-paneled wall looking old and 

brittle in the glass. Wood. Old and brittle. And then my eyes snap open wider than they ever have 
before 

in all of my life. 
The Chest! 

Henri had said it: "Only the two of us can open it together. Unless I die; then you can open it yourself." 

I drop the shard and sprint from my bedroom into Henri's. The Chest is on the floor beside his bed. I 
snatch it, run into the kitchen, and throw it on the table. The lock in the shape of the Loric emblem is 
looking me in the face. 



I sit at the table and stare at the lock. My lip is quivering. I try to slow my breathing but it is useless; my 
chest is heaving as though I just finished a ten-mile sprint. I'm scared of feeling a click beneath my grip. I 
take a deep breath and close my eyes. 

"Please don't open," I say. 

I grab hold of the lock. I squeeze as tightly as I can, my breath held, vision blurry, the muscles in my 



forearm flexed and straining. Waiting for the click. Holding the lock and waiting for the click. 
Only there is no click. 

I let go and slouch in the chair and hold my head in my hands. A small glimmer of hope. I run my hands 
through my hair and stand. On the counter five feet away is a dirty spoon. I focus on it and sweep my 
hand across my body and the spoon goes flying. Henri would be so happy.Henri, I think, where are you? 
Somewhere, and still aliv e, too. And I'm going to come get you. 

I dial Sam's number, the only friend besides Sarah I've made in Paradise, the only friend I've ever had, 
if I'm to be honest. He answers on the second ring. 



"Hello?" 

I close my eyes and pinch the bridge of my nose. I take a deep breath. The shaking has returned, if it 
ever left in the first place. 

"Hello?" he says again. 

"Sam." 

"Hey," he says, then, "You sound like hell. Are you okay?" 
"No. I need your help." 
"Huh? What's happened?" 

"Is there any way your mom can bring you over?" 

"She's not here. She's working a shift at the hospital because she gets paid double time on holidays. 
What's going on?" 

"Things are bad, Sam. And I need help." 

Another silence, then, "I'll get there as quickly as I can." 



"You sure?" 



"I'll see you soon." 

I close my phone and drop my head to the table. Athens, Ohio. That is where Henri is. Somehow, some 
way, that is where I have to go. 

And I need to get there fast. 



CHAPTER NINETEEN 



WHILE I WAIT FOR SAM I WALK THROUGH THEhouse lifting inanimate objects up in the air 



without touching them: an apple from the kitchen counter, a fork in the sink, a small potted plant sitting 

beside the front window. I can only lift the small things, and they rise in the air somewhat timidly. When 
I 

try for something heavierâ€”a chair, a tableâ€”nothing happens. 



The three tennis balls Henri and I use for training sit in a basket on the other side of the living room. I 

bring one of them to me, and as it crosses his line of sight Bernie Kosar stands at attention. Then I throw 

it without touching it and he sprints after it; but before he can get to it, I pull it back, or when he does 

manage to get it, I pull it from his mouth, all while sitting in the chair in the living room. It keeps my 
mind 

from Henri, from the harm that may have found him, and from the guilt of the lies I'll have to tell Sam. 

It takes him twenty-five minutes to ride his bike the four miles to my house. I hear him ride up the drive. 

He jumps off of it and it crashes to the ground while he runs through the front door without knocking, 
out 

of breath. His face is streaked with sweat. He looks around and surveys the scene. 
"So what's up?" he asks. 

"This is going to sound absurd to you," I say. "But you have to promise to take me seriously." 
"What are you talking about?" 

What am I talking about? I'm talking about Henri. He has disappeared because of carelessness, the 

same carelessness he has always preached against. I'm talking about the fact that when you had that 
gun 

on me, I told you the truth. I am an alien. Henri and I came to Earth ten years ago, and we are being 

hunted by a malicious race of aliens. I'm talking about Henri thinking that he could somehow evade 
them 

by understanding them a little more. And now he is gone. That is what I'm talking about, Sam. Do you 
understand?But no, I can't tell him any of these things. 



"My dad's been captured, Sam. I'm not entirely sure by who, or what is being done to him. But 
something has happened, and I think he's being held prisoner. Or worse." 

A grin spreads on his face. "Get out of here," he says. 

I shake my head and close my eyes. The gravity of the situation again makes it difficult to breathe. I turn 
and stare pleadingly at Sam. Tears well up in my eyes. 

"I'm not kidding." 

Sam's face becomes stricken. "What do you mean? Who has captured him? Where is he?" 

"He tracked the writer of one of the articles in your magazine back to Athens, Ohio, and he went there 
today. He went there and he hasn't come back. His phone is off. Som ething has happened to him. 
Something bad." 

Sam becomes more confused. "What? Why would he care? I'm missing something. It's just some stupid 
paper." 

"I don't know, Sam. He's like youâ€” he loves aliens and conspiracy theories and all that stuff," I say, 
thinking quickly. "It's always been a stupid hobby of his. One of the articles piqued his interest and I 
guess he wanted to know more, so he drove down." 

"Was it the article on the Mogadorians?" 



I nod. "How did you know?" 



"Because he looked like he had seen a ghost when I mentioned it on Halloween," he says, and he 
shakes his head. "But why would somebody care if he asked questions about a stupid article?" 

"I don't know. I mean, I would imagine these people aren't the sanest in the world. They're probably 
paranoid and delusional. Maybe they thought he was an alien, the same reason you aimed a gun at me. 
He was supposed to be home by one and his phone is off. That's all I can say." 

I stand and walk to the kitchen table. I grab the slip of paper with the address and phone number of 
where Henri has gone. 

"This is where he went today," I say. "Do you have any idea where it is?" 
He looks at the slip, then at me. 
"You want to go there?" 



"I don't know what else to do." 

"Why can't you just call the cops and tell them what happened?" 

I sit down on the couch, thinking of the best way to respond. I wish I could tell him the truth, that the 
best-case scenario with the cops getting involved would be Henri and I leaving. The worst case would be 
Henri being questioned, maybe fingerprinted, thrust into the sluggish-paced bureaucracy, which would 
give the Mogadorians the chance to move. And once they find us, death is im minent. 

"Call which cops? The ones in Paradise? What do you think they would do if I told them the truth? It 
would take days for them to take me seriously, and I don't have days." 

Sam shrugs. "They might take you seriously. Besides, what if he just got held up, or his phone broke? 
He might be on his way home now." 

"Maybe, but I don't think so. Something feels off, and I have to get there as soon as possible. He was 
supposed to be home hours ago." 

"Maybe he got into an accident." 

I shake my head. "Maybe you're right, but I don't think you are. And if he's being harmed, then we're 
wasting time." 

Sam looks at the sheet of paper. He bites his lip and remains silent for fifteen seconds. 



"Well, I know vaguely how to get to Athens. No idea how to get to this address once we're there, 
though." 

"I can print directions from the internet. I'm not worried about that. The thing I am worried about is 
transportation. I have a hundred and twenty dollars in my room. I can pay someone to drive us, but I 
have no idea who I would ask. There aren't exactly a w hole lot of taxis in Paradise, Ohio." 



"We can take our truck." 
"What truck?" 

"I mean my dad's truck. We still have it. It's sitting in the garage. It hasn't been touched since he 
disappeared." 

I look at him. "Are you serious?" 
He nods. 

"How long has it been? Does it even still run?" 



"Eight years. Why wouldn't it still run? It was nearly new when he bought it." 

"Wait, let me get this right. You're suggesting we drive there ourselves, me and you, two hours to 
Athens?" 

Sam's face twists into a devious smile. "That's exactly what I'm suggesting." 
I lean forward on the sofa. I can't help but smile as well. 

"You know we'll be in deep shit if we get caught, right? Neither of us has our license." 

Sam nods. "My mom will kill me, and she'll maybe kill you, too. And then there is the law. But yeah, if 
you really think your dad is in trouble, what other choice do we have? If the roles were reversed, and it 
was my dad who was in trouble, I would go in a second." 

I look at Sam. There isn't an ounce of hesitation on his face in his suggesting that we drive illegally to a 
town two hours away, and that's not to mention that neither of us knows how to drive and that we have 
no idea what to expect once getting there. And yet Sam is on board. It was his idea even. 

"All right then, let's driv e to Athens," I say. 



I throw my phone in my bag, make sure everything is zipped and in order. Then I walk through the 



house, taking everything in as though it will be the last time I see any of it. It's foolish thinking, and I 
know 

I'm merely being sentimental, but I'm nervous and there is a sort of calming sensation to it. I pick things 
up, then I set them down. After five minutes I am ready. 

"Let's go," I say to Sam. 

"You want to ride on the back of my bike?" 

"You ride; I'll jog alongside." 

"What about your asthma?" 

"I think I'll be okay." 



We leave. He gets on his bike. He tries to ride as fast as he can, but he is not in great shape. I jog a few 
feet behind and pretend that I'm winded. Bernie follows us as well. By the time we get to his house, Sam 
is dripping with sweat. Sam runs into his room and comes out with a backpack. He sets it on the kitchen 
counter and goes to change his clothes. I peer inside of it. There is a crucifix, a few cloves of garlic, a 
wooden stake, a hammer, a blob of Silly Putty, and a pocketknife. 



"You do realize these people aren't vampires, right?" I say when Sam walks back in. 
"Yeah, but you never know. They're probably crazy, like you said." 
"And even if we were hunting vampires, what the hell is the Silly Putty for?" 
He shrugs. "Just want to be prepared." 

I pour a bowl of water for Bernie Kosar and he laps it all up immediately. I change clothes in the 

bathroom and remove the door-to-door directions from my bag. Then I walk out and through the house 

and into the garage, which is dark and smells of gasoline and old grass clippings. Sam flips on the light. 

Various tools have rusted with disuse and hang on the Peg-Board walls. The truck sits in the center of 
the 

garage, covered with a large blue tarp that's coated with a thick layer of dust. 
"How long has it been since this tarp was removed?" 
"Not since Dad went missing." 

I grab one corner, Sam takes the other, and together we peel it away and I set it in the corner. Sam 
stares at the truck, his eyes big, a smile on his face. 

The truck is small, dark blue, room inside for only two people, or maybe a third if they don't mind an 
uncomfortable ride sitting in the center. It will be perfect for Bernie Kosar. None of the dust from the 
past eight years has made it onto the truck, so it sparkles as though it was recently waxed. I throw my 



bag into the bed. 



"My dad's truck," Sam says proudly. "All these years. It looks exactly the same." 
"Our golden chariot," I say. "Do you have the keys?" 

He walks to the side of the garage and lifts a set of keys from a hook on the wall. I unlock the garage 
door and open it. 

"Do you want to paper-rock-scissors to see who drives?" I ask. 

"Nope," Sam says, and then he unlocks the driver's side door and gets in behind the wheel. The engine 
cranks over and finally starts. He rolls down the window. 

"I think my dad would be proud to see me driving it," he says. 

I smile. "I think so, too. Pull it out and I'll close the door." 

He takes a deep breath, and then puts the truck in drive and slowly, timidly, inches it out of the garage. 
He hits the brakes too hard too soon and the truck slams to a stop. 



"You aren't all the way out yet," I say. 

He eases his foot off the brake and then inches the rest of the way out. I close the garage door behind 
him. Bernie Kosar jumps up and in of his own volition and I slide in beside him. Sam's hands are white 
knuckled at the ten and two positions of the wheel. 

"Nervous?" I ask. 

"Terrified." 

"You'll be fine," I say. "We've both seen it done a thousand times before." 
He nods. "Okay. Which way do I turn out of the driveway?" 
"We really going to do this?" 
"Yes," he says. 

"We turn right, then," I say, "and head in the direction away from town." 

We both buckle our seat beats. I crack the window enough so that Bernie Kosar can fit his head out, 
which he does immediately, standing with his hind legs in my lap. 



"I'm scared shitless," Sam says. 



"Me too." 

He takes a deep breath, holds the air in his lungs, and then slowly exhales. 

"And.. .away.. .we. ..go," he says, taking his foot off the brake when he says the last word. The truck 
goes bouncing down the driveway. He hits the brakes once and we skid to a stop. Then he starts again 

and inches down the drive more slowly this time until he stops at the end of it, looks both ways, and 
then 

turns out onto the road. Again, slow at first, then gaining speed. He is tense, leaning forward, and then 
after a mile a grin begins to form on his face and he leans back. 

"This isn't so hard." 

"You're a natural." 

He keeps the truck close to the painted line on the right side of the road. He tenses every time a car 
passes in the opposite direction, but after a while he relaxes and pays the other cars little attention. He 
makes one turn, then another, and in twenty-five minutes we pull onto the interstate. 

"I can't believe we're doing this," Sam finally says. "This is the craziest shit I've ever done." 

"Me too." 

"Do you have any plan when we get there?" 



"None whatsoever. I'm hoping we'll be able to scope the place out and go from there. I have no idea if 
it's a house or an office building or what. I don't even know if he is there." 



He nods. "Do you think he's okay?" 



"I have no idea," I say. 



I take a deep breath. We have an hour and a half to go. Then we'll reach Athens. 



Then we'll find Henri. 



CHAPTER TWENTY 

WE DRIVE SOUTH UNTIL, NESTLED IN THE FOOTHILLS of the Appalachian Mountains, 
Athens comes into view: a small city sprouting through the trees. In the waning light I can see a river 



curling gently around that seems to cup the city, serving as the border to the east, south and west, and 
to 

the north lie hills and trees. The temperature is relatively warm for November. We pass the college 
football stadium. A white-domed arena stands a little beyond it. 

"Take this exit," I say. 

Sam guides the truck off the interstate and turns right onto Richland Avenue. Both of us are elated we 
made it in one piece, and without being caught. 

"So this is what a college town looks like, huh?" 

"I guess so," Sam says. 

Buildings and dorms are on each side of us. The grass is green, meticulously trimmed even though it is 
November. We drive up a steep hill. 

"At the top of this is Court Street. We want to turn left." 

"How far are we?" Sam asks. 

"Less than a mile." 

"Do you want to drive by it first?" 

"No. I think we should park the first opportunity we get and walk." 



We drive down Court Street, which is the main artery in the center of town. Everything is closed for the 
holiday â€”bookstores, coffeehouses, bars. Then I see it, standing out like a jewel. 



"Stop!" I say. 



Sam slams on the brakes. 



"What?!" 



A car honks behind us. 

"Nothing, nothing. Keep driving. Let's park." 

We drive another block until we find a lot to park in. By my guess we are a five-minute walk at most 
from the address. 

"What was that? You scared the crap out of me." 



"Henri's truck is back there," I say. 



Sam nods. "Why do you sometimes call him Henri?" 

"I don't know, I just do. Sort of a joke between us," I say, and look at Bernie Kosar. "Do you think we 
should take him?" 

Sam shrugs. "He might get in the way." 

I give Bernie Kosar a few treats and leave him in the truck with the window cracked. He is n ot happy 
about it and begins whining and scratching at the window, but I don't think we'll be long. Sam and I walk 
back up Court Street, the straps of my bag pulled over my shoulders, Sam holding his in his hand. He has 
removed the Silly Putty and is squeezing it like people do with those foam balls when they're stressed. 
We reach Henri's truck. The doors are locked. There is nothing of importance on the seats or dash. 

"Well, this means two things," I say. "Henri is still here, and whoever has him hasn't discovered his truck 
yet, which means he hasn't talked. Not that he ever would." 

"What would he say if he talked?" 

For a brief moment I had forgotten that Sam knows nothing of Henri's true reasons for being here. I've 
already slipped and called him Henri. I need to be careful not to reveal anything else. 

"I don't know," I say. "I mean, who knows what sorts of questions these weirdos are asking." 



"Okay, now what?" 

I pull out the map to the address Henri had given me that morning. "We walk," I say. 

We walk back the way we came. The buildings end and houses begin. Unkempt and dirty looking. In no 
time at all we reach the address and stop. 

I look at the slip of paper, then at the house. I take a deep breath. 

"This is us," I say. 

We stand looking up at the two-story house with gray vinyl siding. The front walk leads to an unpainted 
front porch with a broken swing hanging unevenly to the side. The grass is long and untended. It looks 
uninhabited, but there is a car in the driveway at the rear. I don't know what to do. I remove my phone. 
It is 11:12.1 call Henri even though I know he won't answer. It's an attempt to establish my wits, to 
come up with a plan. I hadn't thought this far ahead, and now that the reality is here my mind is blank. 
My call goes straight to voice mail. 



"Let me go knock on the door," Sam says. 



"And say what?" 



"I don't know, whatever comes to my mind." 

But he doesn't get a chance to because just then a man walks out of the front door. He is huge, at least 
six feet six, two hundred fifty pounds. He has a goatee and his head is shaved. He's wearing work boots, 

blue jeans, and a black sweatshirt pulled up to his elbows. There is a tattoo on his right forearm, but I 
am 

too far away to see what it is. He spits into the yard, then turns around and locks the front door, walking 

off the porch and heading our way. I stiffen as he approaches. The tattoo is of an alien holding a 
bouquet 

of tulips in one hand as though offering them to some unseen entity. Then the man walks right past us 
without saying a word. Sam and I turn and watch him go. 

"Did you see his tattoo?" I ask. 

"Yeah. And so much for the stereotype of scrawny nerds being the only ones fascinated by aliens. That 
man is huge, and mean looking." 

"Take my phone, Sam." 

"What? Why?" he asks. 

"You have to follow him. Take my phone. I'll go into the house. It's obvious there is nobody there or he 
wouldn't have locked the door. Henri might be in there. I'll call you as soon as I can." 



"How are you going to call me?" 



"I don't know. I'll find a way. Here." He reluctantly takes it. 
"What if Henri isn't in there?" 

"That's why I want you to follow that guy. He might be going to Henri now." 
"What if he comes back?" 

"We'll figure it out. But you have to go now. I promise, I'll call you the first chance I get." 
Sam turns and looks at the man. He is fifty yards away from us now. Then he looks back at me. 
"Okay, I'll do it. But be careful in there." 

"You be careful, too. Don't let him out of your sight. And don't let him see you." 
"Not a chance." 

He turns and hurries after the man. I watch them go and, once they vanish from sight, I walk up to the 
house. The windows are dark, each one covered with a white shade. I can't see in. I walk around to the 
back. There is a small concrete patio leading to a back door, which is locked. I walk the rest of the way 
around the house. Overgrown weeds and bushes left over from summer. I try a window. Locked. All of 



them are locked. Should I break one? I look for rocks among the brambles, and the second I see one 
and lift it from the ground with my mind an idea occur s to me, an idea so crazy that it just might work. 

I drop the rock and walk to the back door. It has a simple lock, no deadbolt. I take a deep breath, 

close my eyes in concentration, and grab hold of the doorknob. I give it a shake. My thoughts move from 

head to heart to stomach; everything is centered there. My grip tightens, my breath is held in 
anticipation 

as I try to envision the inner workings. Then I feel and hear a click in the hand holding the knob. A smile 
forms on my face. I turn the knob and the door swings open. I can't believe I can unlock doors by 
imagining what is inside of them. 

The kitchen is surprisingly clean, the surfaces wiped down, the sink free of dirty dishes. A new loaf of 
bread sits on the counter. I walk through a narrow corridor into a liv ing room with sports posters and 
banners on the walls, a big-screen TV sitting in a corner. The door to a bedroom is off to the left side. I 
poke my head in. It's in a state of disarray, covers thrown aside on the bed, clutter atop the dresser. The 
foul stench of dirty laundry covered in sweat that has never dried. 

At the front of the house, beside the door, a flight of stairs ascends to the second level. I begin walking 
up them. The third step groans under my foot. 



"Hello?" a voice yells from the top of the stairs. 
I freeze, holding my breath. 
"Frank, is that you?" 

I stay silent. I hear somebody stand from a chair, the creak of footsteps on a hardwood floor 
approaching. A man appears at the top of the stairs. Dark shaggy hair, sideburns, an unshaven face. Not 
as big as the man who left earlier, but not exactly small either. 

"Who the hell are you?" he asks. 

"I'm looking for a friend of mine," I say. 

He screws his face up into a scowl, vanishes and reappears five seconds later holding a wooden 
baseball bat in his hand. 

"How did you get in here?" he asks. 

"I would put the bat down if I were you." 

"How did you get in here?" 

"I am faster than you are and I am far stronger." 



"Like hell you are." 



"I'm looking for a friend of mine. He came here this morning. I want to know where he is." 



"You're one of them, aren't you?" 



"I don't know who you are talking about. " 



"You're one of them!" he screams. He holds the bat as a baseball player would, both white -knuckled 
hands at the thin base poised to swing. There is genuine fear in his eyes. His jaw is tightly clenched. 
"You're one of them! Why don't you just leav e us alone already!?" 

"I am not one of them. I've come for my friend. Tell me where he is." 

"Your friend is one of them!" 



"No he isn't." 



"So you know who I'm talking about?" 



"Yes." 

He takes a step down. 

"I'm warning you," I say. "Drop the bat and tell me where he is." 

My hands are shaking from the uncertainty of the situation, from the fact that he has a bat in his hands 
while I have nothing but my own abilities. I'm unnerved by the fear in his eyes. He takes another step 
down. There are only six stairs between us. 

"I'm going to take your head off. That'll send your friends a message." 

"They aren't my friends. And I assure you, you'd be doing them a favor if you hurt me." 

"Let's see then," he says. 

He comes racing down the stairs. There is nothing I can do but react. He swings the bat. I duck and it 

hits the wall with a thud, leaving a large splintered hole in the wood panel. I come up after him and lift 
him 

in the air, one hand gripping his throat, the other in his armpit, carrying him back up the stairs. He flails, 
landing kicks to my legs and groin. The bat drops from his hands. It bounces hollowly down the stairs 
and I hear one of the windows break behind me. 

The second floor is a wide-open loft. It is dark. The walls are covered with issues ofThey Walk Among 



Us , and where the issues end, alien paraphernalia takes up the restâ€”but unlike Sam's, the posters are 

actual photographs taken over the years, blown up and grainy so that it is hard to make them out, 
mostly 

white blips on black backdrops. A rubber alien dummy with a noose around its neck sits in the corner. 
Somebody has added a Mexican sombrero to its head. Glow-in-the-dark stars are stuck to the ceiling. 
They seem out of place, more like something belonging in a ten-year-old girl's room. 

I throw the man to the ground. He scoots away from me and stands up. When he does I put all my 

power into the pit of my stomach and direct it towards him with a hard forward-thrusting motion, and 
he 

goes flying backwards and crashes into the wall. 

"Where is he?" I ask. 

"I'll never tell you. He's one of you." 

"I'm not who you think I am." 



"You guys will never succeed! Just leave Earth alone!" 



I lift my hand and choke him. I can feel the flexed tendons beneath my hand even though I am not 
touching him. He can't breathe and his face turns red. I let go. 

Til ask again." 

"No." 

I choke him once more, but this time when his face turns red I squeeze tighter. When I let go he begins 
to cry and I feel bad for him, for what I've done to him. But he knows where Henri is, has done 
something to him, and my sympathy ends almost as soon as it began. 

After he catches his breath, and between sobs, he says, "He's downstairs." 
"Where? I didn't see him." 

"In the basement. The door is behind the Steelers banner in the living room. " 

I dial my phone number from the telephone atop the middle desk. Sam doesn't answer. Then I pull the 
phone from the wall and break it in half. 

"Give me your cell phone," I say. 

"I don't have one." 

I walk to the dummy and remov e the noose from around its neck. 



"Come on, man," he pleads. 

"Shut up. You've kidnapped my friend. You're holding him against his will. You're lucky all I'm doing is 
tying you up." 

I pull his arms behind him and tie the rope tightly around them, then tie him to one of the chairs. I don't 
think that it will hold him for very long. Then I d uct-tape his mouth shut so that he can't yell and I sweep 
down the stairs and rip the Steelers banner from the wall, revealing a black door that is locked. I unlock 
it as I did the other. A set of wooden stairs leads down to total darkness. 

The smell of mildew reaches my nose. I flip the light switch on and begin walking down, slowly, terrified 
at what I might find. The rafters are littered with cobwebs. I reach the bottom and immediately feel the 
presence of somebody else, somebody there with me. I stiffen, take a deep breath, and then turn. 

There, in the corner of the basement, sits Henri. 



"Henri!" 



He is squinting from the light, his eyes adjusting. A length of duct tape is across his mouth. His hands are 
bound behind him, his ankles tied to the legs of the chair in which he is sitting. His hair is tousled, and 



down the right side of his face is a line of dried blood that looks almost black. The sight of it fills me with 
rage. 

I rush over to him and rip the piece of tape from his mouth. He takes a deep breath. 

"Thank God," he says. His voice is weak. "You were right, John. It was foolish to come here. I'm sorry. 
I should have listened." 

"Shh," I say. 

I bend down and begin untying his ankles. He smells like urine. 

"I was ambushed." 

"How many are there?" I ask. 

"Three." 

"I've tied one of them up upstairs," I say. 



I free his ankles. He stretches his legs out and sighs with relief. 



"I've been in this damn chair all day." 



I begin working his hands free. 



"How in the hell did you get here?" he asks. 



"Sam and I came together. We drove down." 



"You're kidding me?" 



"I had no other way." 



"What did you drive?" 



"His father's old truck." 



Henri is silent a minute while he ponders what that means. 



"He doesn't know anything," I say. "I told him aliens are a hobby of yours, nothing more." 



He nods. "Well, I'm happy you made it. Where is he now?" 



"Trailing one of them. I don't know where they went." 



The creak of a floorboard comes from above us. I stand, Henri's hands only halfway untied. 



"Did you hear that?" I whisper. 



We both watch the door with our breaths held. A foot steps onto the top stair, and then a second, and 



all at once the large man I passed earlier, the one Sam was trailing, comes into view. 

"The party's over, fellas," he says. He is holding a gun aimed at my face. "Now, step away." 

I hold my hands up in front of me and take a step back. I think of using my powers to pull the gun away, 
but what if I somehow cause it to fire by accident? I'm not confident in my abilities just yet. It's too risky. 

"They told us you might be coming. That you would look like humans. That you were the real enemy," 
the man says. 

"What are you talking about?" I ask. 



"They're delusional," Henri says. "They think we're the enemy." 
"Shut up!" the man screams. 

He takes three steps towards me. Then he moves the gun from me and fixes it straight on Henri. 
"One false move by you and he gets it. You understand?" 
"Yes," I say. 

"Now, catch this," he says. He pulls down a roll of duct tape from the shelf beside him and throws it 
towards me. As it moves through the air, I stop it, suspended about eight feet off the ground, halfway 
between us. I start spinning it very quickly. The man stares at it, confused. 

"What the..." 

While he's distracted, I move my arm towards him with a throwing motion. The roll of tape flies back 
and slams him in the nose. Blood starts gushing, and as he reaches for it he drops the gun, which hits the 
ground and goes off. I point my hand towards the bullet and I make it stop, and behind me I hear Henri 
laugh. I move the bullet so that it hangs in front of the man's face. 

"Hey, fat boy," I say. 



He opens his eyes and sees the bullet in the air in front of his face. 



"You're gonna need to bring more." 

I let the bullet fall to the ground at his feet. He turns to run, but I bring him back across the room and 
slam him against a large support pole. It knocks him out and he slumps to the floor. I grab the tape and 
tie him to the pole. After I'm sure he's secured, I turn to Henri and finish freeing him. 

"John, I think that's the best surprise I've ever seen in my entire life," he says in a whisper, such relief in 
his voice that I think tears might come next. 

I smile proudly. "Thanks. It showed at dinner." 

"Sorry I missed it." 

"I told them you were tied up." 



He smiles. 



"Thank God the Legacy came," he says, and I realize that the stress of my Legacies formingâ€”or the 
fear of them not formingâ€”took a far greater toll on Henri than I imagined. 



"So what happened to you?" I ask. 



"I knocked on the door. All three of them were home. When I walked in one of them clubbed me in the 
back of the head. Then I woke up in this chair." He shakes his head and says a long string of words in 
Loric that I know are curses. I finish untying him and he stands and stretches his legs. 

"We need to get out of here," he says. 

"We have to find Sam." 

And then we hear him. 

"John. You down there?" 



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 



EVERYTHING SLOWS. I SEE A SECOND PERSONat the top of the stairs. Sam yelps in surprise 

and I turn to him, silence filling my ears with the discordant hum that comes with slow motion. The man 

behind him gives him a hard shove that causes his feet to leave the ground, and, when he hits, it will be 
at 

the bottom of the stairs, where the concrete floor awaits. I watch him sail through the air, flailing his 
arms 



with a look of terror on his anguished face. Without giving it a single thought, my instinct takes over and 
I 

lift my hands at the very last second and catch him, his head a mere two inches above the basement 
floor. 

I set him down gently. 
"Shit," Henri says. 

Sam sits up and crawls backwards like a crab until he reaches the cinder-block wall. His eyes are 

wide-open, staring at the steps, his mouth moving but no words coming out. The figure who pushed him 

stands at the top of the stairs trying to figure out, like Sam, what just happened. It must be the third 
one. 

"Sam, I tried to--," I say. 

The man at the top of the stairs turns and tries to sprint away but I force him down two of the stairs. 
Sam looks at the man being held by an unseen force, then looks at my one arm extended towards him. 
He is shocked and speechless. 

I grab the duct tape and lift the man in the air and carry him up to the second floor, keeping him 
suspended the entire way. He yells obscenities while I tape him into a chair, but I hear none of them 
because my mind is racing to figure out what we will say to Sam about what just happened. 



"Shut up," I say. 



He unloads another string of cuss words. I decide I've had enough so I tape his mouth shut and walk 
back to the basement. Henri is standing near Sam, who is still sitting there, with the same blank stare on 
his face. 

"I don't get it," he says. "What just happened?" 
Henri and I look at each other. I shrug. 

"Tell me what's happening," Sam says, his voice pleading with us, tinged with desperation to know the 
truth, to know that he's not crazy and that he didn't imagine what he just saw. 

Henri sighs and shakes his head. Then he says, "What the hell's the point?" 

"The point in what?" I ask. 

He ignores me, and instead turns to Sam. He purses his lips together, looks at the man slumped in the 
chair to make sure he is still out, and then at Sam. "We aren't who you think we are," he says, and 
pauses. Sam stays silent, staring at Henri. I can't read his face, and I have no idea what Henri is about to 
tell himâ€” if he will again make up some elaborate story or, for once, tell him the truthâ€” and it's this latter 
that I'm truly hoping for. He looks at me and I nod my head in agreement. 



"We came to Earth ten years ago from a planet named Lorien. We came because it was destroyed by 

the inhabitants of another planet named Mogadore. They destroyed Lorien for its resources because 
they 

had turned their own planet into a cesspool of decay. We came here to hide until we could return to 
Lorien, which we will one day do. But we were followed by the Mogadorians. They are here hunting us. 
And I believ e they are here to take over Earth, and that is why I came here today, to find out a little 
more." 

Sam says nothing. Had it been me who told him as much, I'm sure that he wouldn't believe me, that he 
might become angry, but it is Henri who has told him, and there is a certain integrity within Henri that I 
have always felt, and I have no doubt that Sam feels it also. He looks over at me. 

"I was right: you're an alien. You weren't joking when you admitted it," Sam says to me. 

"Yes, you were right." 

He looks back at Henri. "And those stories you told me on Halloween?" 

"No. Those were just that," Henri says. "Ridiculous stories that made me smile when I stumbled across 
them on the internet, nothing more. But what I told you now is the honest truth." 

"Well...," Sam says, and trails off, grasping for words. "What happened just now?" 

Henri nods to me. "John is in the process of developing certain powers. Telekinesis is one of them. 
When you were pushed, John saved you. " 



Sam still smiles beside me, watching me. When I look at him he nods his head. 



"I knew you were different," he says. 



"Needless to say," Henri says to Sam, "you're going to have to be quiet about this." Then he looks over 



at me. "We need information and we need to get out of here. They're probably nearby." 
"The guys upstairs might still be conscious." 
"Let's go talk to them." 

Henri walks over and picks the gun up from the floor and pulls the clip. It's full. He removes all the 

bullets and sets them on a nearby shelf, then snaps the clip back in and tucks the gun in the waistband 
of 

his jeans. I help Sam to his feet and we all go upstairs to the second floor. The man I brought up with my 
telekinesis is still struggling. The other one is sitting still. Henri walks over to him. 

"You were warned," Henri says. 



The man nods. 

"Now you're going to talk," Henri says, and he pulls the tape from the man's mouth. "And if you 
don't..." He pulls the slide back on the gun and aims it at the man's chest. "Who visited you?" 

"There were three of them," he says. 

"Well, there are three of us. Who cares? Keep talking." 

"They told me if you showed up and I said anything, they'd kill me," the man says. "I won't tell you 
anything more." 

Henri presses the barrel of the gun against the man's forehead. For some reason it makes me 
uncomfortable. I reach out and move the gun down so it points only at the floor. Henri looks at me 
curiously. 

"There are other ways," I say. 

Henri shrugs and sets the gun down. "The floor is yours," he says. 

I stand five feet in front of the man. He looks at me with fear. He is heavy, but after catching Sam as he 
sailed through the air, I know that I can lift him. I hold my arms out, my body straining in concentration. 
Nothing at first, and then very slowly he begins to rise off the floor. The man struggles but he is taped to 
the chair and there is nothing he can do. I concentrate with everything I have, and yet in my peripheral 
vision I can see that Henri is smiling proudly, and that Sam is, too. Yesterday I couldn't lift a tennis ball; 



now I'm lifting a chair with a two-hundred-pound man sitting in it. How quickly the Legacy has 
developed. 

When I have raised him to face level, I flip the chair over and he hangs upside down. 
"Come on!" he yells. 
"Start talking." 

"No!" he yells. "They said they'd kill me." 

I let go of the chair and it falls. The man screams but I catch him before he hits the ground. I raise him 
back up. 



"There were three of them!" he yells, talking fast. "They showed up the same day we sent out the 
magazines. They showed up that night." 



"What did they look like?" Henri asks. 



"Like ghosts. They were pale, almost like albinos. They wore sunglasses, but when we wouldn't talk one 

of them took the sunglasses off. They had black eyes and pointy teeth, but they didn't look natural like 
an 

animal's would. Theirs looked as though they had been broken and chiseled. They all wore long coats 
and hats like some shit out of an old spy movie. What the hell more do you want?" 

"Why did they come?" 

"They wanted to know our source for the story. We told them. A man had called, said he had an 
exclusive for us, starting raging about a group of aliens that wanted to destroy our civilization. But he 
called on the day we were printing, so instead of writing the full story, we put in a small quip and said 
more to follow next month. He talked so fast that we hardly grasped what he was saying. We were 
planning on calling him the next night, only that didn't happen, because the Mogadorians showed up 
instead." 

"How did you know they were Mogadorians?" 

"What the hell else could they have been? We wrote a story about the Mogadorian race of aliens and lo 
and behold a group of aliens shows up on our doorstep the same day wanting to know where we got the 
story. It wasn't hard to figure out." 

The man is heavy and I'm having trouble holding him. My forehead is beaded with sweat and it's a 
struggle to breathe. I flip him back over, begin to lower him. When he is within a foot of the floor I drop 
him the rest of the way and he lands with anOomphf . I bend over with my hands on my knees to catch 
my breath. 



"What the hell, man? I'm answering your questions," he says. 

"I'm sorry," I say. "You're too heavy." 

"And that's the only time they came?" says Henri. 

The man shakes his head. "They came back." 

"Why?" 

"To make sure we didn't print anything else. I don't think they trusted us, but the man who called us 
never answered his phone again, so we had nothing else to print." 

"What happened to him?" 

"What do you think happened?" the man asks. 

Henri nods. "So they knew where he lived?" 

"They had the phone number we were supposed to call him back on. I'm sure they could have figured it 



out." 



"Did they threaten you?" 

"Hell, yes. They trashed our office. They screwed with my mind. I haven't been the same since." 

"What'd they do to your mind?" 

He closes his eyes and takes another deep breath. 

"They didn't even look real," he says. "I mean, here are these three men standing in front of us talking 
in 

deep, raspy voices, all in trench coats and hats and sunglasses even though it was nighttime. It looked 
like 

they were dressed up for a Halloween party or something. They looked funny and out of place, so at first 
I laughed at them....," he says, his voice trailing off. 

"But the second I laughed I knew I had made a mistake. The other two Mogadorians started towards 
me with their sunglasses off. I tried to look away, but I couldn't. Those eyes. I had to look, as though 

something was pulling me there. It was like seeing death. My own death, and the deaths of all the 
people 

I know and love. Things weren't so funny anymore. Not only did I have to witness the deaths, but I 
could feel them, too. The uncertainty. The pain. The complete and utter terror. I wasn't in that room 
anymore. And then came things I've always feared as a kid. Images of stuffed animals that came to life, 
with sharp teeth as mouths, razor blades for claws. The usual stuff all kids are afraid of. Werewolves. 



Demonic clowns. Giant spiders. I viewed them all through the eyes of a child, and they absolutely 
terrified 

me. And every time one of those things bit into me, I could feel its teeth rip the flesh from my body, I 
could feel the blood pour from the wounds. I couldn't stop screaming." 

"Did you try to fight back at all?" 

"They had two of these little weasel-looking things, fat, with short legs. No bigger than a dog. They were 
frothing at the mouth. One of the men was holding them on a leash, but you could tell they were hungry 
for us. They said they would turn them loose if we resisted. I'm telling you, man, these things weren't 
from Earth. If they were dogs, big deal, we would have fought back. But I think those things would have 
eaten us whole despite our size. And they were pulling against the leash, growling, trying to get to us." 

"So you talked?" 

"Yes." 

"When did they come back?" 

"The night before the next magazine went out, a little over a week ago." 

Henri gives me a concerned look. Only one week ago the Mogadorians were within a hundred miles of 
where we live. They could still be here somewhere, maybe monitoring the paper. Perhaps that is why 
Henri has felt their presence of late. Sam stands beside me, taking everything in. 

"Why didn't they just kill you like they did your source?" 



"How the hell do I know? Maybe because we publish a respectable paper." 
"How did the man who called know about the Mogadorians?" 



"He said he had captured one of them and tortured it." 
"Where?" 

"I don't know. His phone number was from the area code near Columbus. So north of here. Maybe 
sixty or eighty miles north." 

"You spoke to him?" 

"Yeah. And I wasn't sure if he was crazy or not, but we had heard rumors about something like this 
before. He started talking about them wanting to wipe out civilization as we know it, and sometimes he 
talked so fast that it was hard to make sense of anything he said. One thing he kept repeating was that 
they were here hunting something, or somebody. Then he started spouting numbers." 



My eyes open wide. "What numbers? What did they mean?" 

"I have no idea. Like I said, he was talking so fast that it was all we could do to write it all down." 
"You wrote while he talked?" Henri says. 

"Of course we did. We're journalists," he says incredulously. "Do you think we make up the stories we 
write?" 

"Yeah, I do," says Henri. 

"Do you still have the notes that you wrote?" I say. 

He looks at me and nods. "I'm telling you, they're worthless. Most of what I wrote are scribbles on their 
plan to destroy the human race." 

"I need to see them," I nearly bellow. "Where, where are they?" 
He motions towards a desk against one of the walls. 
"On the desk. On sticky notes." 

I walk over to the desk, which is covered with papers, and start looking through the sticky notes. I find 
some very vague notes on the Mogadorians' hope to conquer Earth. Nothing concrete, no plans or 
details, just a few indistinct words: 



"Overpopulation" 



"Earth's resources" 



"Biological warfare?" 



"The Planet Mogadore." 



I come to the note I'm looking for. I read it carefully three or four times. 



Planet Lorien? The Loric? 



1 3 dead 



4? 



7 trailed in Spain. 



9 on the run in SA 



(what is he talking about? What do these numbers have to do with invading Earth?) 
"Why is there a question mark after the number 4?" I ask. 
"Because he said something about it but he talked too fast and I didn't get it." 
"You've got to be kidding me?" 

He shakes his head. I sigh.Just my luck, I think.The one thing said about me is the one thing that wasn't 
written. 

"What does V SA' mean?" I ask. 
"South America." 

"Did he say where in South America?" 
"No." 

I nod, stare at the slip of paper. I wish I could have heard the conversation, that I could have asked 
questions of my own. Do the Mogadorians really know where Seven is? Are they really following him or 
her? If so, the Loric charm still holds. I fold the sticky notes and slip them into my back pocket. 



"Do you know what the numbers mean?" he asks. 
I shake my head. "I have no idea. " 
"I don't believe you," he says. 

"Shut up," Sam says, and pokes him in the gut with the heavy end of the bat. 
"Is there anything else you can tell me?" I ask. 

He thinks about it for a moment, then says, "I think bright light bothers them. It seemed to cause them 
pain when they took their sunglasses off." 

We hear a noise downstairs. Like someone trying to slowly open the door. We look at each other. I 
look to the man in the chair. 

"Who is that?" I quietly say. 



"Them." 



"What?" 



"They said they'd be watching. That they knew someone might be coming. " 

We hear quiet footsteps on the first floor. 

Henri and Sam look at each other, both terrified. 

"Why didn't you tell us?" 

"They said they'd kill me. And my family." 

I run to the window, look out the back. We're on the second floor. It's a twenty-foot drop to the 

ground. There's a fence around the yard. Eight feet of wood slats. I move quickly back to the stairs, and 

peer down. I see three huge figures, in long black trench coats, black hats, and sunglasses. They're 

carrying long gleaming swords. There's no way we're going to make it down the stairs. My Legacies are 

growing stronger, but they aren't strong enough to take on three Mogadorians. The only way out is 

through one of the windows or over a small porch at the front of the room. The windows are smaller but 

the backyard will allow us to escape unseen. If we go out the front, we will most likely be visible. I hear 

noise coming from the basement and the Mogadorians talking to each other in an ugly, guttural 
language. 

Two of them move towards the basement while the third starts walking towards the stairs that lead to 
us. 

I have a second or two to act. The windows will break if we go through them. Our only chance is the 



doors leading to the second-floor porch. I open them using telekinesis. It's black outside. I hear 
footsteps coming up the stairs. I pull Sam and Henri over to me and I throw each of them over my 
shoulders like sacks of potatoes. 

"What are you doing?" whispers Henri. 

"I have no idea," I say. "But I hope it works." 

Just as I see the top of the first Mogadorian's hat, I sprint towards the doors and right before the ledge 
of the porch, I jump. We go flying into the night sky. For two or three seconds we're floating. I see cars 
moving down the street beneath us. I see people on the sidewalk. I don't know where we're going to 
land, or if my body will support all the weight I'm carrying when we do. When we hit the roof of a house 
across the street I collapse, with Sam and Henri on top of me. I get my breath knocked out of me, and it 
feels like my legs are broken. Sam starts to stand, but Henri keeps him down. He drags me to the far end 
of the roof and asks if I can use my telekinesis to get him and Sam onto the ground. I can and I do. He 
tells me I need to jump. I stand on legs that are wobbly and still hurt, and just before I jump, I turn and 
see the three Mogadorians are standing on the porch across the street, looking confused. Their swords 
are gleaming. Without a second to spare, we got away without them seeing us. 



We get to Sam's truck. Henri and Sam have to help me walk. Bernie is there waiting for us. We decide 
to leave Henri's truck because they most likely know what it looks like and would track it. We pull out of 
Athens and Henri starts driving back to Paradise, which it really might be after the night we just had. 



Henri starts from the beginning, telling Sam everything. He doesn't stop until we are pulling into our 



driveway. It's still dark. Sam looks over at me. 

"Unbelievable," he says, and smiles. "It's the coolest thing I've ever heard of." I look at him and I see 
the validation he has always looked for in his life, an affirmation that the time he's spent with his nose in 
the conspiracy rags, looking for clues to his father's disappearance, wasn't in vain. 

"Are you really resistant to fire?" he asks. 

"Yes," I say. 

"God, that's awesome." 

"Thanks, Sam." 

"Can you fly?" he asks. At first I think he is joking, but then I see that he isn't. 

"I can't fly. I'm resistant to fire and can turn my hands into lights. I have telekinesis, which I only learned 



to use yesterday. More Legacies are supposed to come soon. We think so, anyhow. But I have no idea 
what they will be until they actually develop." 

"I hope you learn to make yourself invisible," Sam says. 

"My grandfather could. And anything he touched also became invisible." 

"Seriously?" 

"Yes." 

He starts laughing. 

"I still can't believe you two drove all the way to Athens by yourselves," Henri says. "You guys are 
really something. When we stopped for gas I saw that the plates have been expired for four years. I 
really don't see how you made it without getting stopped." 

"Well, you can count on me from now on," says Sam. "I'll do whatever it takes to help stop them. 
Especially because I bet they're the ones who took my dad." 

"Thanks, Sam," says Henri. "The most important thing you could do is stay quiet with our secret. If 
anyone else finds out about this it could lead to our deaths." 

"Don't worry. I'll never tell anyone. I don't want John using his powers on me." 



We laugh and thank Sam again and he pulls away. Henri and I go inside. Even though I slept on the 
drive back, I'm still exhausted. I lie down on the couch. Henri sits in a chair across from me. 

"Sam won't say anything," I say. 

He doesn't respond, just stares at the floor. 

"They don't know we're here," I say. 



He looks up at me. 



"They don't," I say. "If they knew they'd be following us now." 



He stays silent. I can't take it. 



"I'm not leaving Ohio on nothing more than speculation." 



Henri stands. 



"I'm happy that you've made a friend. And I think Sarah is great. But we can't stay. I'm going to start 
packing," he says. 

"No." 

"When we're packed I'll go into town and buy a new truck. We need to get out of here. They might not 

have followed us, but they know how close they were at catching us, and that we might still be nearby. I 

believe the man who called the magazine did in fact capture one of them. That was his story, that he 

captured one and tortured it until it talked and then he killed it. We don't know what kind of tracking 

technology they have, but I don't think it will take them long to find us. And when they do, we'll die. 

Your Legacies are emerging, and your strength is growing, but you're nowhere near ready to fight 
them." 

He walks out of the room. I sit up. I don't want to leave. I have a real friend for the first time in my life. 
A friend who knows what I am and isn't scared, doesn't think I'm a freak. A friend who is willing to fight 
with me, and go into danger with me. And I have a girlfriend. Someone who wants to be with me, even 
without knowing who I am. Someone who makes me happy, someone I would fight for, or go into 
danger in order to protect. My Legacies haven't all emerged yet, but enough of them have. I took down 
three grown men. They didn't stand a chance. It was like fighting with little kids. I could do anything I 
wanted to them. We also now know that humans can also fight, and capture, and hurt, and kill 
Mogadorians. If they can, then I definitely can. I don't want to leave. I have a friend, and I have a 
girlfriend. I am not going to leave. 

Henri walks back out of his room. He is carrying the Loric Chest that is our most prized possession. 



"Henri," I say. 



"Yes?" 



"We're not leaving. " 
"Yes we are." 

"You can if you want, but I'll go live with Sam. I'm not leaving." 
"This is not your decision to make." 

"It's not? I thought I was the one being hunted. I thought I was the one in danger. You could walk away 
right now and the Mogadorians would never look for you. You could live a nice, long, normal life. You 
could do whatever you want. I can't. They will always be after me. They will always be trying to find me 
and kill me. I'm fifteen years old. I'm not a kid anymore. It is my decision to make." 



He stares at me for a minute. "That was a good speech, but it doesn't change anything. Pack your stuff. 
We're leaving. " 



I raise my hand and point it at him and lift him off the ground. He's so shocked that he doesn't say 
anything. I stand and move him into the corner of the room, up near the ceiling. 

"We're staying," I say. 

"Put me down, John." 

"I'll put you down when you agree to stay." 
"It's too dangerous." 

"We don't know that. They're not in Paradise. They might not have any idea where we are." 

"Put me down." 

"Not until you agree to stay." 

"PUT ME DOWN." 

I don't say anything back. I just hold him there. He struggles, tries to push off the wall and the ceiling, 
but he can't move. My power holds him in place. And I feel strong doing it. Stronger than I've ever felt in 
my life. I am not leaving. I am not running. I love my life in Paradise. I love having a real friend, and I love 
my girlfriend. I'm ready to fight for what I love, be it with the Mogadorians, or be it with Henri. 

"You know you're not coming down until I bring you down." 



"You're acting like a child." 



"No, I'm acting like someone who is starting to realize who he is and what he can do." 
"And you're really going to keep me up here?" 

"Until I fall asleep or get tired, but I'll just do it again once I get some rest." 

"Fine. We can stay. With certain conditions." 

"What?" 

"Put me down and we'll talk about it." 

I lower him, set him on the floor. He hugs me. I'm surprised; I expected him to be pissed. He lets go of 
me and we sit down on the couch. 

"I'm proud of how far you've come. I've spent many years waiting and preparing for these things to 
happen, for your Legacies to arrive. You know my entire life is devoted to keeping you safe, and making 
you strong. I would never forgive myself if something happened to you. If you died on my watch, I'm not 
sure how I would go on. In time the Mogadorians will catch up with us. I want to be ready for them 
when they come. I don't think you are yet, even though you do. You have a long way to go. We can stay 



here, for now, if you agree that training comes first. Before Sarah, before Sam, before everything. And at 

the first sign that they're nearby, or are on our trail, we leave, no questions asked, no fighting about it, 
no 

levitating me up to the ceiling and holding me there." 
"Deal," I say, and smile. 



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 

WINTER COMES EARLY AND WITH FULL FORCEto Paradise, Ohio. First the wind, then the 

cold, then the snow. Light dustings to start, then a storm blows through and buries the land so that the 

scraping sound of snowplows is as consistently heard as the wind itself, leaving a coat of salt over 

everything. School is canceled for two days. The snow near the roads segues from white to dingy black 

and eventually melts to standing puddles of slush that refuse to drain. Henri and I spend my time off 

training, indoors, outdoors. I can now juggle three balls without touching them, which also means I can 
lift 

more than one thing at a time. The heavier and larger objects have come, the kitchen table, the 
snowblower Henri bought the week before, our new truck, which looks almost exactly like the old one 



and like millions of other pickup trucks in America. If I can lift it physically, with my body, then I can lift it 
with my mind. Henri believes that the strength of my mind will eventually transcend that of my body. 

In the backyard the trees stand sentinel around us, frozen branches like figurines of hollow glass, an inch 
of a fine white powder piled atop each one. The snow is up to our knees aside from the small patch 
Henri has cleared away. Bernie Kosar sits watching from the back por ch. Even he wants nothing to do 
with the snow. 

"Are you sure about this?" I ask. 

"You need to learn to embrace it," Henri says. Over his shoulder, watching with morbid curiosity, stands 
Sam. It is his first time watching me train. 

"How long will this burn?" I ask. 
"I don't know." 

I am wearing a highly combustible suit made mostly of natural fibers soaked in oils, some of which are 

slow burning, some of which are not. I want to set it on fire just to be rid of the smells that are making 
my 

eyes water. I take a deep breath. 
"Are you ready?" he asks. 



"As ready as I'll ever be." 



"Don't breathe. You're not immune to the smoke or fumes and your internal organs will burn." 



"This seems foolish to me," I say. 



"It's part of your training. Grace under pressure. You need to learn to multitask while consumed in 
flames." 



"But why?" 

"Because when the battle comes, we're going to be greatly outnumbered. Fire will be one of your great 
allies in war. You need to learn to fight while burning." 

"Ugh." 

"If you get in trouble, jump into the snow and start rolling." 

I look at Sam, who has a big grin spread across his face. He is holding a red fire extinguisher in his hand 
just in case it's needed. 



"I know," I say. 



Everyone is silent while Henri messes with the matches. 
"You look like Sasquatch wearing that suit," Sam says. 
"Eat it, Sam," I say. 
"Here we go," says Henri. 

I take a deep breath just before he touches a match to the suit. Fire sweeps across my body. It feels 
unnatural for me to keep my eyes open, but I do. I look up. The fire rises eight feet above me. The whole 
world is shrouded in shades of orange, red, yellow that dance in my line of sight. I can feel the heat, but 
only slightly as one feels the sun's rays on a summer day. Nothing more than that. 

"Go!" Henri yells. 

I hold my arms out to my sides, eyes wide-open, breath held. I feel as though I'm hovering. I enter the 
deep snow and it begins to sizzle and melt underfoot, a slight steam rising while I walk. I reach my right 
hand forward and lift a cinder block, which feels heavier than normal. Is it because I'm not breathing? Is 
it the stress of the fire? 

"Don't waste time!" Henri yells. 

I hurl the block as hard as I can against a dead tree fifty feet away. The force causes it to smash into a 



million little pieces, leaving an indentation in the wood. Then I raise three tennis balls soaked in 
gasoline. I 

juggle them in midair, one over the other. I bring them in towards my body. They catch fire, and still I 
juggle themâ€”and while doing so I lift a long, thin broomstick. I close my eyes. My body is warm. I 
wonder if I'm sweating. If I am, the sweat must be evaporating the second it reaches the skin's surface. 

I grit my teeth, open my eyes, thrust my body forward and direct all of my powers into the stick's very 

core. It explodes, splintering into small bits. I don't let any of them fall to the ground; instead I keep 
them 

suspended, collectively looking like a cloud of dust hovering in midair. I pull them to me and let them 
burn. The wood pops through the flicker and hum of the flames. I force them back together into a tightly 
compacted spear of fire that looks as though it has sprung straight from the depths of hell. 

"Perfect!" Henri yells. 

One minute has passed. My lungs begin to burn from the fire, from my breath still held. I put everything 



that I am into the spear and I hurl it so hard that it speeds through the air like a bullet and hits the tree, 

and hundreds of tiny fires spread throughout the vicinity and extinguish almost immediately. I had 
hoped 

the dead wood would catch fire but it does not. I have also dropped the tennis balls. They sizzle in the 



snow five feet away from me. 



"Forget the balls," Henri yells. "The tree. Get the tree." 

The dead wood looks ghastly with its arthritic limbs silhouetted against the world of white beyond it. I 

close my eyes. I can't hold my breath much longer. Frustration and anger begin to form, fueled by the 
fire 

and the discomfort of the suit and the tasks that are left undone. I focus on the large branch coming off 

the tree's trunk and I try to break that branch away but it won't come. I grit my teeth and furrow my 

brows and finally a loud snap rings through the air like a shotgun blast and the branch comes sailing 

towards me. I catch it in my hands and hold it straight above me. Let it burn, I think. It must be twenty 

feet long. It finally catches fire and I lift it into the air forty or fifty feet above me and, without touching 
it, I 

drive it straight into the ground as though I'm staking my claim like some old-world swordsman standing 

atop the hill after winning the war. The stick totters back and forth smoking, flames dancing along the 

upper half of it. I open my mouth and instinctively take a breath, and the flames come rushing in; an 

instant burning spreads throughout my body. I'm so shocked and it hurts so much that I don't know 
what 

to do. 

"The snow! The snow!" Henri yells. 

I dive in headfirst and begin rolling. The fire goes out almost immediately but I keep rolling and the 
sizzle 

of snow touching the tattered suit is all I hear while wisps of steam and smoke rise off of me. And then 

Sam finally pulls the clip from the extinguisher and unloads with a thick powder that makes it even 
harder 



to breathe. 
"No," I yell. 

He stops. I lie there trying to catch my breath, but each inhalation brings about a pain in my lungs that 
reverberates throughout my body. 

"Damn, John. You weren't supposed to breathe," Henri says, standing over me. 

"I couldn't help it." 

"Are you okay?" Sam asks. 

"My lungs are burning. " 

Everything is blurry but slowly the world comes into focus. I lie there looking up into the low gray sky at 
the flakes of snow sifting sullenly down upon us. 

"How'd I do?" 

"Not bad for your first try." 

"We're going to do it again, aren't we?" 

"In time, yes." 



"That was wicked cool," Sam says. 

I sigh, then take a deep, labored breath. "That sucked." 

"You did well for your first time," Henri says. "You can't expect everything to come easily." 

I nod from the ground. I lie there a good minute or two, and then Henri extends a hand and helps me up, 
bringing about the end of training for the day. 



I wake in the middle of the night two days later, 2:57 on the clock. I can hear Henri working at the 
kitchen table. I crawl out of bed and walk out of the room. He is hunched ov er a document, wearing 
bifocals and holding some sort of stamp with a pair of tweezers. He looks up at me. 

"What are you doing?" I ask. 



"Creating forms for you." 



"For what?" 



"I got to thinking about you and Sam driving down to get me. I think it's foolish of us to keep using your 
real age when we can just as easily change it according to our needs." 

I pick up a birth certificate that he has already finished. The name written is James Hughes. The date of 
birth would make me a year older. I'd be sixteen and able to drive. Then I bend over and look at the one 
he is in the process of creating. The name listed is Jobie Frey, age eighteen, a legal adult. 

"Why didn't we ever think to do this before?" I ask. 

"We never had reason to." 

Papers of different shapes and sizes and densities are scattered across the table, a large printer off to 
the 

side. Bottles of ink, rubber stamps, notary stamps, metal plate-looking things, various tools that look as 

though they belong in a dentist's office. The process of document creation has always remained foreign 
to 

me. 

"Are we going to change my age now?" 

Henri shakes his head. "It's too late to change your age in Paradise. These are mostly for the future. 
Who knows what will happen that will give you reason to use them. " 



The thought of moving in the future makes me nauseous. I would rather stay fifteen and unable to drive 
forev er than move someplace new. 



Sarah returns from Colorado a week before Christmas. I haven't seen her in eight days. It feels as 
though it's been a month. The van drops all the girls off at the school and one of her friends drives her 
straight to my house without first taking her home. When I hear the tires come up the drive I meet her 
with a hug and a kiss and I lift her off the ground and twirl her in the air. She has just been in a plane and 



a car for ten hours and she is wearing sweatpants and no makeup with her hair pulled into a ponytail 
and 

yet she is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen and I don't want to let go of her. We stare into each 
other's eyes beneath the moonlight and all either of us can do is smile. 

"Did you miss me?" she asks. 

"Every second of every day." 

She kisses the tip of my nose. 



"I missed you, too." 

"So do the animals have a shelter again?" I ask. 

"Oh, John, it was amazing! I wish you could have been there. There were probably thirty people helping 
out at all times, around the clock. The building went up so fast and it's so much nicer than it was before. 
We built this cat tree in one of the corners, and I swear the whole time we were there, there were cats 
playing on it." 

I smile. "It sounds great. I wish I could have been there, too." 
I take her bag and we walk into the house together. 
"Where's Henri?" she asks. 

"Grocery shopping. He left about ten minutes ago." 

She walks through the living room and drops her coat onto the back of a chair on her way into my 
bedroom. She sits on the edge of my bed and kicks her shoes off. 

"What should we do?" she asks. 

I stand there watching her. She is wearing a red hooded sweatshirt with a zipper down the front. It is 
only halfway zipped. She smiles and looks at me through the tops of her eyes. 



"Come here," she says, and holds her hand out to me. 

I walk to her and she takes my hand in hers. She looks up at me and squints her eyes from the light 
shining overhead. I snap my fingers with my free hand and the light turns off. 

"How'd you do that?" 

"Magic," I say. 

I sit beside her. She tucks a few loose strands of hair behind her ear, then leans over and kisses me on 
the cheek. Then she cups my chin and pulls my head to hers and kisses me again, softly, delicately. My 
whole body tingles in response. She pulls away, her hand still on my cheek. She traces my brow with her 
thumb. 

"I really did miss you," she says. 



"Me, too." 



A silence passes between us. Sarah bites her lower lip. 

"I couldn't wait to get here," she says. "The whole time I was in Colorado, you were all I could think of. 
Even when playing with the animals, I was wishing you were there with me playing with them, too. And 
then when we finally left this morning, the entire trip was hell even though every mile we traveled was 
another mile I was closer to you." 

She smiles, mostly with her eyes, her lips a thin upturned crescent that keeps her teeth hidden. She 

kisses me again, a kiss that starts as slow and lingering and goes from there. Both of us are sitting on the 

edge of the bed, her hand on the side of my face, mine on the small of her back. I can feel the tight 

contours beneath the tips of my fingers, can taste the berry gloss on her lips. I pull her to me. I feel as 

though I can't get close enough to her despite our bodies being pressed tightly together. My hand 
running 

up her back, the smooth porcelain feel of her skin. Her hands through my hair, both of us breathing 
heavily. We fall back on the bed, on our sides. Our eyes are closed. I keep opening mine to see her. The 
room is dark aside from the moonlight entering through the windows. She catches me watching her and 
we stop kissing. She puts her forehead to mine and stares at me. 

She places her hand on the back of my neck and pulls me to her and all at once we're kissing again. 

Entangled. Meshed. Our arms tightly around the other. My mind clear of every plague that normally 
visits 

and every thought of other planets, my mind free of the hunt and pursuit by the Mogadorians. Sarah 
and I 

on the bed kissing each other, falling into each other. Nothing else in the world matters. 
And then the door opens in the living room. We both jump up. 



"Henri's home," I say. 

We stand and quickly brush the wrinkles from our clothes, smiling, a secret shared between us that 
makes us giggle as we walk out of the bedroom holding hands. Henri is setting a bag of groceries on the 
kitchen table. 

"Hi, Henri," Sarah says. 

He smiles at her. She lets go of my hand and walks over and hugs him and they star t talking about her 
trip to Colorado. I walk outside to get the rest of the groceries. I breathe in the cold air, try to shake my 

limbs free of the tension of what just happened, and the disappointment of Henri coming home when 
he 

did. I'm still breathing heavily as I grab the rest of the groceries and carry them into the house. Sarah is 
telling Henri about some of the cats that were at the shelter. 

"And you didn't bring one of them back for us?" 

"Now Henri, you know I would have happily brought you one if you had told me," Sarah says, her arms 
folded across her chest with her hip cocked to the side. 

He smiles at her. "I know you would've." 

Henri puts the groceries away and Sarah and I head out into the frigid air to go for a walk before her 
mom arrives to take her home. Bernie Kosar comes with us. He takes the lead and runs ahead. Sarah 
and I hold hands, walking through the yard, the temperature slightly above freezing. The snow melting, 
the ground wet and muddy. Bernie Kosar disappears for a time into the woods and then comes running 



back out. His bottom half is filthy. 
"What time is your mom coming?" I ask. 
She looks at her watch. "Twenty minutes." 
I nod. "I'm so happy you're back." 
"Me too." 

We go to the edge of the woods but it is too dark for us to enter. We instead walk along the perimeter 
of the yard, hand in hand, occasionally stopping to kiss with the moon and stars as witnesses. Neither of 
us talks about what just happened, but it's obvious that it is on both of our minds. When we make the 
first lap Sarah's mother pulls into the drive. She's ten minutes early. Sarah runs up and hugs her. I walk 
inside and grab Sarah's bag. After we say good-bye, I walk to the road and watch their taillights recede 
in the distance. I stand outside for a while and then Bernie Kosar and I go back into the house. Henri is 
halfway through making dinner. I give the dog a bath. When I'm finished dinner is ready. 



We sit at the table and eat, not a word passing between us. I can't stop thinking of her. I stare blankly 
into my plate. I'm not hungry but I try to force the food down anyhow. I manage a few bites, and then I 
push the plate out in front of me and I sit there in silence. 

"So are you going to tell me?" Henri asks. 

"Tell you what?" 

"What's on your mind." 

I shrug. "I don't know." 

He nods, goes back to eating. I close my eyes. I can still smell Sarah on the collar of my shirt, can still 
feel her hand on my cheek. Her lips to mine, the texture of her hair when I ran my hand through it. All I 
can think about is what she must be doing, and how I wish she were still here. 

"Do you think it's possible for us to be loved?" I ask. 

"What are you talking about?" 

"By humans. Do you think we can be loved, like, truly be loved by them?" 

"I think they can love us the way they love each other, especially if they don't know what we are, but I 
don't think it's possible to love a human the way you would love a Loric," he says. 



Why? 



"Because deep down we're different from them. And we love differently. One of the gifts our planet 
gave us is to love completely. Without jealousy or insecurity or fear. Without pettiness. Without anger. 
You may have strong feelings for Sarah, but they aren't what you would feel for a Loric girl." 

"There aren't many Loric girls available for me." 



"Even more reason to be careful with Sarah. At some point, if we last long enough, we will need to 
regenerate our race and repopulate our planet. Obviously you're a long way from having to worry about 
that, but I wouldn't count on Sarah being your partner." 

"What happens if we try to have children with humans?" 

"It's happened many times before. Usually it results in an exceptional and gifted human. Some of the 
greatest figures in Earth's history were actually the product of humans and the Loric, including Buddha, 
Aristotle, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Thomas 
Jefferson, and Albert Einstein. Many of the ancient Greek gods, who most people believ e were 
mythological, were actually the children of the humans and Loric, mainly because it was much more 



common then for us to be on this planet and we were helping them develop civilizations. Aphrodite, 
Apollo, Hermes, and Zeus were all real, and had one Loric parent." 

"So it is possible." 

"It was possible. In our current situation it's reckless and impractical. In fact, though I don't know her 
number, or have any idea where she is, one of the children who came to Earth with us was the daughter 
of your parents' best friends. They used to joke that it was fate that the two of you would end up 
together. They may well have been right." 

"So what do I do?" 

"Enjoy your time with Sarah, but don't get too attached to her, and don't let her get too attached to 
you." 

"Really?" 

"Trust me, John. If you never believe another word I say, then believe that." 
"I believe all the words you say even if I don't want to." 
Henri winks at me. "Good," he says. 

Afterwards I go into my room and call Sarah. I think about what Henri said to me before I do it, but I 
can't help myself. I am attached to her. I think I'm in love with her. We talk for two hours. It is midnight 



when the call ends. Then I lie in bed smiling through the darkness. 



CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE 



THE DAY HAS GROWN DARK. THE WARM NIGHTcarries a soft wind and the sky is scattered 

with intermittent flashes of light, clouds turning to brilliant colors of blue and red and green. Fireworks 
at 

first. Fireworks that segue to something else, louder, more menacing, theooh s andaah s turning to 
shrieks 

and screams. A chaos erupts. People running, children crying. Me, standing in the middle of it all, 
watching without the benefit of being able to do anything to help. The soldiers and the beasts pour onto 
the scene from all directions as I have seen before, the continuous fall of bombs so loud that it hurts the 
ears, the reverberations felt in the pit of my stomach. So deafening it makes my teeth ache. Then the 
Loric charge back with such intensity, with such courage, that it makes me proud to be among them, to 



be one of them. 



Then I am gone, sweeping through the air at a rate that causes the world beneath to pass in a blur so 
that 

I can't focus on any one thing. When I stop I am standing on the tarmac of an airfield. A silver airship is 
fifteen feet away and forty or so people stand at the ramp leading up to its entrance. Two people have 
already entered, standing in the doorway with their eyes on the sky, a very young girl and a woman 
Henri's age. And then I see myself, four years old, crying, shoulders slumped. A much younger v ersion of 
Henri just behind me. He, too, is watching the sky. On bended knee in front of me is my grandmother, 
gripping me by the shoulders. My grandfather stands behind her, his face set hard, distracted, the lenses 
of his glasses gathering the light from the sky. 

"Come back to us, you hear? Come back to us," my grandmother says, finishing speaking. I wish I 

could have heard the words that came before them. Up until now I have never remembered anything 
that 

was spoken to me that night. But now I have something. My four-year-old self doesn't respond. My 
four-year-old self is too scared. He doesn't understand what is happening, why there is urgency and fear 

in the eyes of everyone around him. My grandmother pulls me to her and then she lets go. She stands 
and 

turns her back to keep me from seeing her cry. My four-year-old self knows that she is crying, but he 
doesn't know why. 

Next is my grandfather, who is covered in sweat, grime, and blood. He has clearly been fighting, and his 

face is twisted as though he is straining, ready to fight more, ready to go and do all he can in the struggle 

to survive. His, and the planet's. He drops to a knee as my grandmother did before him. For the first 
time 

I look around. Twisted heaps of metal, chunks of concr ete, large holes in the ground where the bombs 
have fallen. Scattered fires, shattered glass, dirt, splintered trees. And in the middle of it all a single 
airship, unharmed, the one that we are boarding. 



"We gotta go!" somebody yells out. A man, dark hair and eyes. I don't know who he is. Henri looks at 
him and nods. The children walk up the ramp. My grandfather fixes me with a hard stare. He opens his 

mouth to speak. But before the words come I am again swept away, hurled up through the air, the 
world 

below again passing in a blur. I try to make it out, but I am moving too fast. The only discernible sights 
are the bombs, continually falling, large displays of fire of all colors that sweep through the night sky and 
the perpetual explosions that follow. 

Then I stop again. 

I am inside of a large, open building that I have never seen before. It is silent. The ceiling is domed. The 

floor is one great slab of concrete the size of a football field. There are no windows, but the sounds of 
the 

bombs still penetrate, echoing off the walls around me. Standing in the very middle of the building, tall 
and 

proud, alone, is a white rocket that extends all the way to the apex of the ceiling. 

Then a door slams open in the far corner. My head snaps around to it. Two men enter, frantic, talking 
quickly and loudly. All at once a herd of animals rush in behind the men. Fifteen, give or take, continually 
changing shape. Some flying, some running, on two legs, then on four. Bringing up the rear, a third man 
follows and the door is shut. The first man reaches the spacecraft, opens a sort of hatch on the ship's 
bottom, and begins ushering the animals in. 

"Go! Go! Up and in, up and in," he yells. 

The animals go, all of them changing their shapes in order to do so. Then the last animal enters and one 



of the men pulls himself in. The other two begin throwing bags and boxes up to him. It takes them a 
good 

ten minutes to get everything on board. Then all three scatter around the rocket, preparing it. The men 



are sweating, moving frantically until everything is ready. Just before the three of them climb inside the 

rocket, someone runs up with a bundle that looks like a swaddled child, though I can't see well enough 

to tell. They take whatever it is and go inside. Then the door snaps shut behind them and is sealed. 

Minutes pass. The bombs must be just outside the walls now. And then from nowhere an explosion 

occurs inside the building and I see the beginnings of fire shoot from the bottom of the rocket, a fire 
that 

quickly grows, a fire that consumes everything inside the building. A fire that consumes even me. 

My eyes snap open. I am back home, in Ohio, lying in bed. The room is dark, but I can sense that I am 
not alone. A figure moves, a shadow thrown across the bed. I tense myself to it, ready to snap my lights 
on, ready to hurl it against the wall. 

"You were talking," Henri says. "In your sleep just now, you were talking." 

I turn on my lights. He is standing beside the bed, wearing pajamas pants and a white T-shirt. His hair is 
tousled; his eyes are red with sleep. 



"What was I saying?" 



"You said v Up and in, up and in.' What was happening?" 
"I was just on Lorien." 
"In a dream?" 

"I don't think so. I was there, just like before." 
"What did you see?" 

I scoot up the bed so my back rests against the wall. 
"The animals," I say. 
"What animals?" 

"In the spaceship I saw take off. The old one, at the museum. In the rocket that left after ours. I 
watched 

animals being loaded into it. Not many. Fifteen, maybe. With three other Loric. I don't think they were 
Garde. And something else. A bundle. It looked like a baby, but I couldn't tell." 

"Why don't you think they were Garde?" 



"They loaded the rocket with supplies, fifty or so boxes and duffel bags. They didn't use telekinesis." 
"Into the rocket inside the museum?" 

"I think it was the museum. I was inside a large, domed building with nothing inside of it but a rocket. I 
can only assume it was the museum." 

Henri nods. "If they worked at the museum then they would have been C pan." 
"Loading animals," I say. "Animals that could change their shape." 



"Chim ra," Henri says. 



"What?" 



"Chim ra. Animals on Lorien that could change their shape. They were called Chim ra." 

"Is that what Hadley was?" I ask, remembering back to the vision I had a few weeks ago, the vision of 
playing in the yard of my elders' home when I was lifted in the air by the man wearing a silver and blue 



suit. 



Henri smiles. "You remember Hadley?" 

I nod. "I've seen him the way that I've seen everything else." 

"You're having the visions even when we're not training?" 

"Sometimes." 

"How often?" 

"Henri, who cares about the visions? Why were they loading animals into a rocket? What was a baby 
doing with them, or was it even a baby? Where did they go? What purpose could they possibly have 
had?" 

Henri thinks about it a moment. He shifts the weight of his body to his right leg. "Probably the same 

purpose we had. Think about it, John. How else could animals repopulate Lorien? They too would have 

to go to some sort of sanctuary. Everything was wiped out. Not just the people, but also the animals, 
and 

all plant life. Maybe the bundle was just another animal. A fragile one, or maybe a young one." 
"Well, where would they go? What other sanctuary exists besides Earth?" 

"I think they went to one of the space stations. A rocket with Loric fuel would have been able to make it 



that far. Maybe they thought the invasion would be short-lived, and they thought they could wait it out. 
I 

mean, they would have been able to live on the space station for as long as their supplies lasted." 
"There are space stations close to Lorien?" 

"Yes, two of them. Well, therewere two of them. I know for sure the larger of the two was destroyed at 
the same time as the invasion. We lost contact with it less than two minutes after the first bomb fell." 

"Why didn't you mention that before, when I first told you about the rocket?" 

"I had assumed that it was empty, that it went up in the air as a decoy. And I think that if one space 
station was destroyed, then the other was as well. Their trip, unfortunately, was probably done in vain, 
whatever their goal was." 

"But what if they came back when their supplies ran out? Do you think they could survive on Lorien?" I 
ask in desperation. I already know the answer, already know what Henri will say, but I ask anyway in 
order to hold on to some sort of hope that we aren't alone in all this. That maybe, somewhere far away, 
there are others like us, waiting, monitoring the planet so that they, too, might one day return and we 
won't be alone when we go back. 



"No. There is no water there now. You saw that for yourself. Nothing but a barren wasteland. And 
nothing can survive without water." 

I sigh and scoot back down into the bed. I drop my head onto the pillow. What's the point in arguing? 
Henri is right and I know it. I saw it for myself. If the globes that he pulled from the Chest are to be 

trusted, then Lorien is nothing more than wasteland, a dump. The planet still lives but on the surface 
there 

is nothing. No water. No plants. No life. Nothing but dirt and rocks and the rubble of the civilization that 
once existed. 

"Did you see anything else?" Henri asks. 

"I saw us on the day we left. All of us at the airship right before we took off. " 
"It was a sad day." 

I nod. Henri crosses his arms and gazes out the window, lost in thought. I take a deep breath. "Where 
was your family during it all?" I ask. 

My lights have been off for a good two or three minutes, but I can see the whites of Henri's eyes staring 
back at me. 

"Not with me, not on that day," he says. 

We are both silent for a time and then Henri shifts his weight. 



"Well, I better get back to bed," he says, bringing an end to the conversation. "Get some sleep." 

After he leaves I lie there thinking of the animals, of the rocket, of Henri's family and how I'm sure he 
never got the chance to say good-bye to them. I know I won't be able to go back to sleep. I never can 
when the images visit me, when I feel Henri's sadness. It must be a thought constantly on his mind, as it 
would be for anyone who left under the same circumstances, leaving the only home you've ever known, 
all the while knowing you will never see the people you love again. 

I grab my cell phone and text Sarah. I always text her when I can't sleep, or she texts me if it's the other 
way around. Then we'll talk for as long as it takes to become tired. She calls me twenty seconds after I 
hit the send button. 

"Hey, you," I answer. 
"You can't sleep?" 
"No." 

"What's the matter?" she asks. She yawns on the other end of the line. 

"Was just missing you is all. Been lying in bed staring at the ceiling for like an hour now." 



"You're silly. You saw me like six hours ago." 



"I wish you were still here," I say. She moans. I can hear her smile through the darkness. I roll to my 



side and hold the phone between my ear and the pillow. 
"Well, I wish I was still there, too." 

We talk for twenty minutes. The last half of the call is both of us just lying there listening to the other 
breathe. I feel better after having talked to Sarah, but I find it even harder to fall back asleep. 



CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR 



FOR ONCE, SINCE WE ARRIVED IN OHIO, THINGSseem to slow for a time. School ends quietly 

and for winter break we have eleven days off. Sam and his mother spend most of it visiting his aunt in 

Illinois. Sarah stays home. We spend Christmas together. We kiss when the ball drops at midnight on 

New Year's Eve. Despite the snow and the cold, or maybe even in retaliation against it, we go for long 

walks through the woods behind my house, holding hands, kissing, breathing in the chilly air beneath 
the 



low gray skies of winter. We spend more and more time together. Not a day passes during that whole 
break that we don't see each other at least once. 

We walk hand in hand beneath an umbrella of white from the snow piled atop the tree branches 
overhead. She has her camera with her and occasionally stops to take pictures. Most of the snow on the 

ground lies undisturbed aside from the tracks we have made on the walk out. We follow them back 
now, 

Bernie Kosar in the lead, darting in and out of the brambles, chasing rabbits into small groves and 
thickets of thorny bush, chasing squirrels up trees. Sarah wears a pair of black earmuffs. Her cheeks and 
the tip of her nose are red with the cold, making her eyes look bluer. I stare at her. 

"What?" she asks, smiling. 

"Just admiring the view." 

She rolls her eyes at me. For the most part the woods are dense aside from sporadic clearings we 
continually stumble upon. I'm not sure how far in any one direction the woods extend, but in all of our 
walks we hav e yet to reach their end. 

"I bet it's beautiful here in the summer," Sarah says. "We can probably picnic in the clearings." 

An ache forms in my chest. Summer is still five months away and if Henri and I are here in May, we will 
have made it seven months in Ohio. That is very nearly the longest we have ever stayed in one place. 



"Yeah," I agree. 



Sarah looks at me. "What?" 



I look at her questioningly. "What do you mean, v what?"' 



"That wasn't very convincing," she says. A mess of crows fly by overhead, squawking noisily. 



"I just wish it was summer now." 



"Me too. I can't believe we have to go back to school tomorrow." 



"Ugh, don't remind me." 

We enter another clearing, larger than the others, an almost perfect circle a hundred feet in diameter. 
Sarah lets go of my hand, runs into the middle of it, and drops into the snow, laughing. She rolls to her 
back and begins making a snow angel. I drop beside her and do the same. The tips of our fingers just 
barely touch while we make the wings. We get up. 

"It's like we're holding wings," she says. 



"Is that possible?" I ask. "I mean, how would we fly if we're holding wings?" 
"Of course it's possible. Angels can do anything." 

Then she turns and nuzzles into me. Her cold face against my neck makes me squirm away from her. 
"Ahh! Your face is like ice." 
She laughs. "Come warm me up." 

I take her in my arms and kiss her beneath the open sky, the trees surrounding us. There are no sounds 
save the birds and the occasional pack of snow falling from the nearby branches. Two cold faces pressed 
tightly together. Bernie Kosar comes trotting up, out of breath, tongue dangling, tail wagging. He barks 
and sits in the snow staring at us, his head cocked to the side. 

"Bernie Kosar! Were you off chasing rabbits?" Sarah asks. 

He barks twice and runs over and jumps up on her. He barks again and pushes off and then looks up 

expectantly. She grabs a stick from the ground, shakes the snow off it, and then hurls it into the trees. 
He 

races after it and disappears from sight. He emer ges from the trees ten seconds later, but instead of 
returning to the clearing where he had exited it, he comes from the opposite side. Sarah and I both spin 
around to watch him. 



"How'd he do that?" she asks. 



"Don't know," I say. "He's a peculiar dog." 



"Did you hear that, Bernie Kosar? He just called you peculiar!" 

He drops the stick at her feet. We walk towards home, holding hands, the day nearing dusk. Bernie 
Kosar trots beside us the whole way out, his head on a swivel as though ushering us along, keeping us 
safe from what may or may not lurk in the outer dark beyond our line of sight. 



Five newspapers are stacked on the kitchen table, Henri at his computer, the overhead light on. 

"Anything?" I ask out of habit, nothing more. There hasn't been a promising story in months, which is a 
good thing, but I can't help but always hope for something every time I ask. 

"Actually, yes, I think so." 



I perk up, then walk around the table and look over Henri's shoulder at the computer screen. "What?" 



"There was an earthquake in Argentina yesterday evening. A sixteen-year-old girl pulled an elderly man 
free from a pile of rubble in a tiny town near the coast." 



"Number Nine?" 

"Well, I certainly think she's one of us. Whether she's Number Nine or not remains to be seen." 

"Why? There's nothing really extraordinary about pulling a man from rubble." 

"Look," Henri says, and then scrolls to the top of the article. There is a picture of a large slab of 
concrete at least a foot thick, eight feet long and wide. "This is what she lifted to save him. It must weigh 
five tons. And look at this," he says, and scrolls back to the bottom of the page. He highlights the very 
last sentence. It reads: "Sofia Garc a could not be found for comment." 

I read the sentence three times. "She couldn't be found," I say. 
"Exactly. She didn'tdecline to comment; she simply couldn't be found." 
"How did they know her name?" 

"It's a small town, less than a third the size of Paradise. Most everyone would know her name there." 
"She left, didn't she?" 

Henri nods. "I think so. Probably before the paper was even published. That's the downfall of small 



towns; it's impossible to remain unnoticed." 



I sigh. "Hard for the Mogadorians to go unnoticed too." 
"Precisely." 

"Sucks for her," I say, and stand up. "Who knows what she must have left behind." 

Henri gives me a skeptical look, opens his mouth to say something, but then thinks better of it and goes 
back to the computer. I return to my bedroom. I pack my bag with a fresh change of clothes and the 
books I'll need for the day. Back to school. I'm not looking forward to it, though it'll be nice to see Sam 
again, whom I haven't seen in nearly two weeks. 

"Okay," I say. "I'm off." 

"Have a good day. Be safe out there." 

"See you this afternoon." 

Bernie Kosar rushes out of the house ahead of me. He's a ball of energy this morning. I think he's come 
to look forward to our morning runs, and the fact that we haven't done one in a week and a half has him 
chomping at the bit to get back to it. He keeps up with me for most of the run. Once we make it I give 
him a good pet and scratch behind his ears.

"All right, boy, go home," I say. He turns and starts trotting back to the house. 

I take my time in the shower. By the time I finish, other students are beginning to arrive. I walk the hall, 
stop by my locker, then go to Sam's. I slap him on the back. It startles him, then he flashes a big toothy 
grin when he sees that it's me. 

"I thought I was going to have to whip somebody's ass there for a minute," he says. 
"Just me, my friend. How was Illinois?" 

"Ugh," he says, and rolls his eyes. "My aunt made me drink tea and watch reruns ofLittle House on the 
Prairie nearly every day." 

I laugh. "That sounds awful." 

"It was, trust me," he says, and reaches into his bag. "This was waiting in the mail when we got back." 
He hands me the latest issue ofThey Walk Among Us . I begin flipping through it. 
"There is nothing on us or the Mogadorians," he says. 



"Good," I say. "They must fear us after you visited them." 



"Yeah, right." 

Over Sam's shoulder I see that Sarah is coming our way. Mark James stops her in the middle of the 
hallway and hands her a few sheets of orange paper. Then she continues on her way. 

"Hi, gorgeous," I say when she reaches us. She stands on her toes to kiss me. Her lips taste like 
strawberry lip balm. 

"Hi, Sam. How are you?" 

"Good. How're you?" he asks. He seems at ease with her now. Before the incident with Henri, which 
was a month and a half ago, being in Sarah's presence would have made him uncomfortable, and he 
wouldn't have been able to meet her eye or know what to do with his hands. But now he looks at her 
and smiles, speaking with confidence. 

"Good," she says. "I'm supposed to give you both one of these." 

She hands us each one of the orange sheets Mark just gave her. It's a party invitation for this upcoming 
Saturday night at his house. 

"I'm invited?" Sam asks. 



Sarah nods. "All three of us are." 



"Do you want to go?" I ask. 



"Maybe we could give it a shot." 



I nod. "You interested, Sam?" 

He looks past Sarah and me. I turn to see what he is looking at, or rather who. At a locker across the 
hall is Emily, the girl who was on the hayride with us, and who Sam has been pining for ever since. When 
she walks past she sees that Sam is watching her and she smiles politely. 

"Emily?" I say to Sam. 

"Emily what?" Sam asks, looking back at me. 
I look at Sarah. "I think Sam likes Emily Knapp." 
"I do not," he says. 



"I could ask her to come to the party with us," Sarah says. 



"Do you think she would go?" Sam asks. 



Sarah looks at me. "Well, maybe I shouldn't invite her since Sam doesn't like her." 



Sam smiles. "Okay, fine. I just, I don't know." 



"She kept asking why you never called after the hayride. She kind of likes you." 



"That is true," I say. "I've heard her say it." 



"Why didn't you tell me?" says Sam. 



"You never asked." 



Sam looks down at the flyer. "So it's this Saturday?" 



"Yes." 



He looks up at me. "I say we go." 



I shrug. "I'm in." 



Henri is waiting for me when the final bell rings. As always, Bernie Kosar is in the passenger seat, and 

when he sees me, his tail begins wagging a hundred miles an hour. I jump into the truck. Henri puts it 
into 

gear and drives away. 

"There was a follow-up article on the girl in Argentina," Henri says. 
"And?" 

"Just a short article saying that she has disappeared. The mayor of the town is offering a modest reward 
for information on her whereabouts. It sounds like they believe she's been kidnapped." 



"Are you worried about the Mogadorians having gotten to her first?" 

"If she's Nine, like the note we found indicated, and the Mogadorians were tracking her, it's a good 
thing that she vanished. And if she's been captured, the Mogadorians can't kill her â€”they can't even hurt 

her. That gives us hope. The good thing, aside from the news itself, is that I imagine every Mogadorian 
on 



Earth has poured into Argentina." 



"Speaking of which, Sam had the latest issue ofThey Walk Among Us today." 

"Was there anything in it?" 

"Nope." 

"I didn't think there would be. Your levitation trick seemed to affect them rather profoundly." 

When we arrive home I change clothes and meet Henri in the backyard for our day of training. Working 

while consumed with fire has gotten easier. I don't get as flustered as I did on that first day. I can hold 
my 

breath longer, close to four minutes. I have more control over the objects I lift, and I can lift more of 
them 

at the same time. Little by little, the look of worry I saw on Henri's face during the first days has melted 
away. He nods more. He smiles more. On the days it goes really well he gets a crazed look in his eyes 
and he raises his arms in the air and yells "Yes!" as loudly as he can. In that way I am gaining confidence 
in my Legacies. The rest have yet to come, but I don't think they're far off. And the major one, whatever 
it will be. The anticipation of it keeps me up most nights. I want to fight. I hunger for a Mogadorian to 
saunter into the backyard so that I may finally seek revenge. 

It's an easy day. No fire. Mostly just me lifting things and manipulating them while they are suspended 
in 

the air. The last twenty minutes pass with Henri throwing objects at meâ€” sometimes just allowing them 
to 



fall to the ground, other times deflecting them in a way that emulates a boomerang so that they twist in 
the 

air and go blazing back towards Henri. At one point a meat tenderizer flies back so fast that Henri div es 
face-first into the snow to keep from being hit by it. I laugh. Henri does not. Bernie Kosar lies on the 
ground the whole time watching us, seeming to offer his own encouragement. After we are done I 
shower, do my homework, and sit at the kitchen table for dinner. 

"So there is a party this Saturday that I'm going to go to." 

He looks up at me, stops chewing. "Whose party?" 

"Mark James's." 

Henri looks surprised. 

"All that's over," I say before he can object. 

"Well, you know best, I suppose. Just remember what's at stake." 



CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE 



AND THEN THE WEATHER WARMS. BRISK WINDS,bitter cold, and continuous snow showers 
are followed by blue skies and fifty-degree temperatures. The snow melts. At first there are standing 
puddles in the driveway and the yard, the road wet with the sounds of splashing tires, but after a day all 
the water drains and evaporates and the cars pass as they do on any other day. A lull in the action, a 
brief reprieve before old man winter takes up the reins again. 

I sit on the porch waiting for Sarah, staring up at the night sky full of twinkling stars and a full moon. A 
thin, knifelike cloud cuts the moon in two and then quickly disappears. I hear the crunch of gravel under 
tires; then headlights come into view and the car pulls into the driveway. Sarah gets out of the driv er's 
side. She's dressed in dark gray pants flared at the ankles, a navy blue cardigan sweater beneath a beige 
jacket. Her eyes are accentuated by the blue shirt peeking out where the jacket's zipper ends. Her blond 
hair falling past her shoulders. She smiles coyly and looks at me, fluttering her eyelashes as she 
approaches. There are butterflies in my stomach. Almost three months together and yet I still grow 
nervous when I see her. A nervousness that's hard to imagine time will ever assuage. 

"You look gorgeous," I say. 

"Well, thank you," she says, and bobs a curtsy. "You don't look so bad yourself." 

I kiss Sarah on the cheek. Then Henri walks out of the house and waves to Sarah's mom, who is sitting 
in the passenger seat of the car. 



"So you'll call when you're ready to be picked up, right?" Henri asks me. 



"Yes," I say. 

We walk to the car and Sarah gets behind the wheel. I sit in the back. She's had her learner's permit fo r 
a few months now, which means she can driv e so long as a licensed driver sits in the passenger seat 
beside her. Her actual driver's test is on Monday, two days away. She's been anxious about it ev er since 
making the appointment over winter break. She backs out of the driveway and pulls away, eventually 
flipping the visor down and smiling at me through the mirror. I smile back. 

"So how was your day, John?" her mother turns and asks me. We make small talk. She tells me of the 

trip to the mall that the two of them made earlier in the day, and how Sarah drove. I tell her about 
playing 

with Bernie Kosar in the yard, and about the run we w ent on after. Idon't tell her about the training 

session that lasted for three hours in the backyard after the run. I don't tell her how I split the dead 
tree's 

trunk straight down the middle through telekinesis, or how Henri threw knives at me that I deflected 
into 

a sandbag fifty feet away. I don't tell her about being lit on fire or the objects that I lifted and crushed 
and 

splintered. Another kept secret. Another half-truth that feels like a lie. I would like to tell Sarah. I 
somehow feel that I'm betraying her by keeping myself hidden, and over the last few weeks the burden 
has really begun to weigh on me. But I also know I have no other choice. Not at this point, anyhow. 

"So it's this one?" Sarah asks. 



"Yes," I say. 



She pulls into Sam's driveway. He paces at the end of it, dressed in jeans and a wool sweater. He looks 

up at us with a deer-caught-in-the-headlights blank stare. There is gel in his hair. I've never seen gel in 
his 

hair before. He walks to the side of the car, opens the door, and slides in beside me. 
"Hi, Sam," Sarah says, then introduces him to her mom.

Sarah reverses the car out of the driveway and pulls onto the road. Both of Sam's hands are planted 

firmly on the seat in nervousness. Sarah turns down a road I've never seen before and makes a right 
turn 

into a winding driveway. Thirty or so cars are parked along the side of it. At the end of the driveway, 
surrounded by trees, is a large, two-story house. We can hear the music well before we reach the house. 

"Jeez, nice house," Sam says. 

"You guys be good in there," Sarah's mom says. "And be safe. Call if you need anything, or if you can't 
get ahold of your father," she says, looking at me. 



"Will do, Mrs. Hart," I say. 



We get out of the car and begin walking to the front door. Two dogs run up to us from the side of the 
house, a golden retriever and a bulldog. Their tails are wagging and they're sniffing spastically at my 
pants, smelling the scent of Bernie Kosar. The bulldog is carrying a stick in his mouth. I wrestle it away 
from him and throw it across the yard and both dogs sprint after it. 

"Dozer and Abby," Sarah says. 

"I take it Dozer is the bulldog?" I ask. 

She nods and smiles at me as though in apology. I'm reminded how well she must know this house. I 
wonder if it's odd for her to be back now, with me. 

"This is a horrible idea," Sam says. He looks at me. "I'm only now realizing that." 
"Why do you think so?" 

"Because only three months ago the guy who lives here filled both our lockers with cow manure and hit 
me in the back of the head with a meatball during lunch. And now we're here." 

"I bet Emily is already here," I say, and nudge him with my elbow. 

The door opens into the foyer. The dogs come rushing in past us and disappear into the kitchen, which 
lies straight ahead. I can see that Abby is now holding the stick. We're met with loud music that we have 



to yell over to be heard. People are dancing in the living room. There are cans of beer in most of their 
hands, a few people drinking bottled water or soda. Apparently Mark's parents are out of town. The 
whole football team is in the kitchen, half of them wearing their letterman jackets. Mark comes up and 
hugs Sarah. Then he shakes my hand. He holds my gaze for a second and then looks away. He doesn't 
shake Sam's hand. He doesn't even look at him. Perhaps Sam is right. This may have been a mistake. 

"Happy you guys could make it. Come on in. Beer's in the kitchen." 

Emily stands in the far corner talking to other people. Sam looks her way, then asks Mark where the 
bathroom is. He points the way. 

"Be right back," Sam says to me. 

Most of the guys are standing around the island in the middle of the kitchen. They look at me when 
Sarah and I enter. I look at each of them in turn, and then grab a bottle of water from the ice bucket. 



Mark hands Sarah a beer and opens it for her. The way he looks at her makes me realize yet again just 
how little I trust him. And I realize now just how bizarre this whole situation is. Me, being in his house 
now, with Sarah, his ex-girlfriend. I'm happy that Sam is with me. 



I reach down and play with the dogs until Sam comes out of the bathroom. By then Sarah has made her 
way to the corner of the living room and is talking to Emily. Sam tenses beside me when he realizes that 
there is nothing else for us to do but walk up to them and say hello. He takes a deep breath. In the 
kitchen two of the guys have lit a corner of the newspaper on fire for no other reason than to watch it 
burn. 

"Make sure you compliment Emily," I say to Sam as we approach. He nods. 
"There you guys are," Sarah says. "I thought you had left me all by my lonesome." 
"Wouldn't dream of it," I say. "Hi, Emily. How are you?" 
"I'm good," she says, then to Sam, "I like your hair." 
Sam just looks at her. I nudge him. He smiles. 
"Thank you," he says. "You look very nice." 

Sarah gives me a knowing look. I shrug and kiss her on the cheek. The music has grown even louder. 
Sam talks to Emily, somewhat nervously, but she laughs and after a while he eases a little. 

"So are you okay?" Sarah asks me. 

"Of course. I'm with the prettiest girl at the party. How could things be better?" 



"Oh shush," she says, and pokes me in the stomach. 

The four of us dance for an hour or so. The football players keep drinking. Somebody shows up with a 
bottle of vodka and not long after that one of themâ€” I don't know whichâ€”throws up in the bathroom so 

that the smell of vomit wafts throughout the whole downstairs. Another one passes out on the living- 
room 

sofa and some of the others draw with marker on his face. People keep filtering in and out of the 
doorway leading to the basement. I have no idea what is going on down there. I haven't seen Sarah for 
the past ten minutes. I leave Sam and walk through the living room and the kitchen, then walk up the 
stairs. White, thick carpet, walls lined with art and family portraits. Some of the bedroom doors are 
open. Some are closed. I don't see Sarah. I walk back downstairs. Sam is standing sullenly by himself in 
the corner. I walk over to him. 

"Why the long face?" I ask. 

He shakes his head. 

"Don't make me lift you in the air and turn you upside down like the guy in Athens." 
I smile, Sam doesn't. 



"I just got cornered by Alex Davis," he says. 



Alex Davis is another of Mark James's brood, a wide receiver for the team. He's a junior, tall and thin. 
I've never talked to him before, and likewise know little else about him. 

"What do you mean by v cornered'?" 

"We just talked. He saw that I've been talking to Emily. I guess they dated over the summer." 

"So what. Why does that bother you?" 

He shrugs. "It just sucks, and it bothers me, okay?" 

"Sam, do you know how long Sarah and Mark dated?" 

"For a long time." 

"Two years," I say. 

"Does it bother you?" he asks. 

"Not in the least. Who cares about her past? Besides, look at Alex," I say, and nod to him standing in 

the kitchen. He is slumped against the kitchen counter, his eyes aflutter, a thin layer of sweat glistening 
on 



his forehead. "Do you really think she misses being with that?" 
Sam looks at him, shrugs. 

"You're a good dude, Sam Goode. Don't get down on yourself." 
"I'm not down on myself." 

"Well then, don't worry about Emily's past. We don't have to be defined by the things we did or didn't 
do in our past. Some people allow themselv es to be controlled by regret. Maybe it's a regret, maybe it's 
not. It's merely something that happened. Get over it." 

Sam sighs. He's still wrestling with it. 

"Go on. She likes you. There's nothing to be scared of," I say. 
"I am, though." 

"Best way to deal with fear is to confront it. Just walk up to her and kiss her. I bet you she kisses you 
back." 

Sam looks at me and nods, then goes to the basement, where Emily is hanging out. The two dogs come 
wrestling into the living room. Tongues dangling. Tails wagging. Dozer drops his chest to the ground and 
waits for Abby to come near enough and then he jumps at her and she jumps away. I watch them until 
they disappear up the stairs, playing tug-of-war with a rubber toy. It's a quarter till midnight. A couple is 



making out on the couch across the room. The football players are still drinking in the kitchen. I'm 
starting to get sleepy. I still can't find Sarah. 

Just then one of the football players comes rushing up the basement stairs, a crazed, frantic look in his 

eyes. He rushes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water as high as it will go, and begins throwing open 
the 



kitchen-cupboard doors. 



"There's a fire downstairs!" he says to the guys nearby. 



They begin filling pots and pans with water, and one by one they rush down the stairs. 



Emily and Sam come up the stairs. Sam looks shaken. 



"What's wrong?" I say. 



"The house is on fire!" 



"How bad?" 



"Is any fire good? And I think we started it. We, uh, knocked a candle into a curtain." 

Sam and Emily both look disheveled and have clearly been making out. I make a mental note to 
congratulate Sam later. 

"Have you seen Sarah?" I ask Emily. 

She shakes her head. 

More guys rush up the stairs, Mark James with them. There is fear in his eyes. For the first time I smell 
smoke. I look at Sam. 

"Go outside," I say. 

He nods and takes Emily's hand and they leave together. Some of the others follow, but some stay 

where they are, watching with drunken curiosity. A few people stand around stupidly patting the 
football 

players on the back as they rush up and down the basement stairs, cheering them on as though it's all a 
joke. 

I go to the kitchen and grab the largest thing left, a medium-sized metal pot. I fill it with water and then 
go downstairs. Everybody has evacuated aside from us battling the blaze, which is far bigger than I 
expected. Half the basement is consumed in flames. Dousing it with the little water I have left is 
completely futile. I don't try, and instead drop the pot and dash back up. Mark comes flying down. I 
stop him in the middle of the stairway. His eyes are swimming in booze but through it I can see that he is 



terrified, that he is desperate. 

"Forget about it," I say. "It's too big. We have to get everyone out." 

He looks down the stairs at the fire. He knows that what I've said is true. The tough-guy front is gone. 
There is no more pretending. 

"Mark!" I yell. 

He nods and drops the pot and we go back up together. 
"Everybody out! Now!" I yell when I get to the top of the stairs. 



Some of the drunker ones don't move. Some of them laugh. One person says, "Where's the 
marshmallows?" Mark slaps him across the face. 

"Get out!" he screams. 

I rip the cordless phone from the wall and shove it into Mark's hand. 



"Dial 91 1," I yell over the loud voices and the music that still blares from somewhere like a sound track 
to the erupting pandemonium. The floor is getting warm. Smoke begins to billow up from beneath us. 
Only then do people take it seriously. I start pushing them towards the door. 

I dart past Mark as he begins dialing and rush through the house. I take the stairs three at a time and 
kick through the open doors. One couple is making out on a bed. I yell at them both to get out. Sarah's 

nowhere to be found. I sprint back down the stairs and through the door into the dark, cold night. 
People 

are standing around, watching. Some of them I can tell are excited by the prospect of the house burning 
down. Some laugh. I can feel myself begin to panic. Where is Sarah? Sam stands at the back of the 
crowd, which must total a hundred people. I run to him. 

"Have you seen Sarah?" I ask. 

"No," he says. 

I look back at the house. People are still coming out. The basement windows glow red, flames licking 

against the panes of glass. One of them is open. Black smoke pours out of it and floats high in the air. I 

weave through the crowd. Just then an explosion rattles the house. All the basement windows shatter. 

Some of the people cheer. The flames have reached the first floor, and they're moving fast. Mark James 

stands at the front of the crowd, unable to divert his gaze away from it. His face is illuminated by the 

orange glow. There are tears in his eyes, a look of despair, the same look that I saw in the eyes of the 

Loric on the day of the invasion. What an odd thing it must be to watch everything you've ever known 
be 

destroyed. The fire spreads with hostility, with disregard. All Mark can do is watch. Flames are beginning 



to rise up past the first-floor windows. We can feel the heat on our faces fr om where we stand. 



"Where's Sarah?" I ask him. 

He doesn't hear me. I shake him by the shoulder. He turns and looks at me with a blankness that 
suggests he still doesn't believe what his own eyes are telling him. 

"Where's Sarah?" I ask again. 

"I don't know," he says. 

I start to weave through the crowd looking for her, getting more and more frantic. Everyone is watching 
the blaze. The vinyl siding has begun to bubble and melt. The curtains in the windows have all burned 
away. The front door stands open, smoke pouring out of the top of it like an upside-down waterfall. We 

can see all the way into the kitchen, which is an inferno. On the left side of the house the fire has 
reached 

the second floor. And that's when we all hear it. 

A long terrible scream. And dogs barking. My heart drops. Every person there strains to listen while 
hoping like hell we didn't hear what we all know we did. And then it comes again. Unmistakable. It 
comes in a torrent and this time it doesn't let up. Gasps filter throughout the crowd. 



"Oh no," Emily says. "Oh God no, please no." 



CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX 

NOBODY SPEAKS. ALL EYES ARE WIDE-OPEN, staring up in shock. Sarah and the dogs must be 
somewhere in the back. I close my eyes and lower my head. All I can smell is the smoke. "Just 
remember what's at stake," Henri had warned. I know damn well what's at stake, but still his voice 
echoes. My life, and now Sarah's life. There is another scream. Terrified. Severe. 

I feel Sam's eyes on me. He has seen firsthand my resistance to fire. But he also knows how I am 
hunted. I glance around. Mark is on his knees, rocking himself back and forth. He wants it over with. He 
wants the dogs to stop barking. But they don't stop, and he takes each bark as though being stabbed in 
the gut with a knife. 

"Sam," I say so that only he can hear, "I'm going in." He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, fixes me 
with a stare. 

"Go get her," he says. 

I hand him my phone and tell him to call Henri if for some reason I don't make it out. He nods. I begin 



moving to the back of the crowd, weaving in and out of the mass of bodies. Nobody pays me any 

attention. When I finally reach the back I make a mad dash for the yard's perimeter and then sprint to 
the 

rear of the house so that I can enter without being seen. The kitchen is completely submerged in flame. I 

watch it for a brief moment. I can hear Sarah and the dogs. They sound closer now. I take a deep breath 

and with that breath other things come. Anger. Determination. Hope and fear. I let them in, I feel them 
all. 

And then I lunge forward and sweep across the yard and burst into the house. I am swallowed by the 

inferno immediately, hearing nothing but the crackle and hum of the flames. My clothes catch fire. 
There 

is no end to the blaze. I move to the front of the house and half of the stairs have burned away. What is 

left is on fire, looking brittle, but there isn't time to test them. I rush up but they collapse under my 
weight 

when I reach the halfway point. I tumble down with them, the fire rising as though someone has stoked 
the flames. Something pierces my back. I grit my teeth, still holding my breath. I stand from the rubble 
and listen to Sarah screaming. She's screaming and she's scared and she's going to die, die a hideous 
miserable death if I don't get to her. Time is short. I'll have to jump to the second floor. 

I jump and grab hold of the edge of the floor and pull myself up. The fire has spread to the other side of 

the house. She and the dogs are somewhere to my right. I leap down the hallway, checking rooms. The 

pictures on the walls have burned in their frames, nothing more than blackened silhouettes melted to 
the 

wall. Then my foot falls through the floor and my breath catches in surprise and I breathe in. Nothing 
but 

smoke and flame enter. I begin coughing. I cover my mouth with my arm but it does little to help. Smoke 
and fire are burning my lungs. I drop to a knee, coughing, gasping. Then a fury surges through me and I 
stand back up and I move on, hunched over, gritting my teeth, determined. 



And then I find them in the last room on the left. Sarah is screaming, "HELP!" The dogs are whining and 
crying. The door is closed and I kick it open, send it flying off its hinges. All three of them are huddled as 
tightly against one another as far into the corner as they can get. Sarah sees me and yells my name and 
starts to stand. I motion to her to stay where she is, and as I step into the room, a huge flaming support 
beam falls between us. I raise my hand and send it upwards, crashing through what remains of the roof. 
Sarah seems confused by what she's just seen. I leap towards her, covering twenty feet in a single 



bound, moving straight through the flames without them affecting me at all. The dogs are at her feet. I 
push the bulldog into her arms and pick up the retriever. With my other arm I help her stand. 

"You came," she says. 

"No one, and nothing, will ev er hurt you as long as I'm alive," I say back to her. 

Another huge beam falls and takes out part of the floor, landing in the kitchen below us. We need to get 

out the back of the house so no one sees me, or sees what I think I'm going to need to do. I hold Sarah 

tight against my side and the dog against my chest. We take two steps, then leap over the flaming 
chasm 

created by the fallen beam. As we start to move down the hall, a huge explosion below takes out most 
of 



it. The hallway is gone; where it used to be are a wall and a window, quickly being consumed by flames. 
Our only chance is through the window. Sarah is screaming again, clutching my arm, and I can feel the 
dog's claws digging into my chest. I lift my hand towards the window, stare at it, and focusâ€”and it 
blows out of its frame, leaving us the opening we need. I look at Sarah, pulling her securely against my 
side. 

"Hold on tight," I say. 

I take three steps and dive forward. The flames swallow us whole but we fly through the air like a bullet, 
heading straight towards the opening. I'm worried we're not going to make it. We barely clear it, and I 

feel the edge of the shattered frame scrape against my arms and the tops of my legs. I hold Sarah and 
the 

dog as best as I can, and twist my body so that I'll land on my back and everyone else will be on top of 
me. We hit the ground with a thud. Dozer goes rolling. Abby yelps. I hear the breath go out of Sarah. 
We're about thirty feet behind the house. I feel a cut on the top of my head from the broken glass of the 
window. Dozer is the first one up. He seems fine. Abby is a little slower. She limps on her front paw, but 
I don't think it is anything serious. I lie on my back and hold Sarah. She is starting to cry. I can smell her 
singed hair. Blood drips down the side of my face and gathers in my ear. 

I sit in the grass to catch my breath. Sarah is in my arms. The bottoms of my shoes have melted. My 
shirt has completely burned away, and so have most of my jeans. Small cuts traverse the length of both 
arms. But I am not burned at all. Dozer walks over and licks my hand. I pet him. 

"You're a good boy," I say between Sarah's sobs. "Go on. Get your sister and go back up front." 



There are sirens in the distance that should be here within the next minute or two. The woods are 
about 

a hundred yards from the back of the house. Both dogs sit watching me. I nod to the front of the house 

and they get up as if they understand and both begin walking that way. Sarah is still in my arms. I turn 
her 

so she is cradled in them and I stand and head to the woods, carrying her as she cries on my shoulder. 
Just as I enter them I hear the whole crowd erupt in cheers. Dozer and Abby must have been seen. 

The woods are dense. The full moon still shines but there is little light coming from it. I turn my hands 
on 

so we can see. I start to shiver. Panic sweeps through me. How will I explain this to Henri? I'm wearing 
what now look like singed cutoffs. My head is bleeding. So is my back, along with various cuts on my 
arms and legs. My lungs feel as though they are on fire with every breath I take. And Sarah is in my arms. 
She now must know what I can do, what I am capable of, or at least some of it. I'm going to have to 
explain everything to her. I'll have to tell Henri she knows. I already have too many strikes against me. 
He'll say someone will slip at some point. He'll insist we leave. There's no way around it. 

I set Sarah down. She's stopped crying. She looks at me, confused, scared, bewildered. I know I need 
to get some clothes and get back to the party so that people aren't suspicious. I need to get Sarah back 



so people don't think she's dead. 



"You're okay to walk?" I say. 

"I think so." 

"Follow me." 

"Where are we going?" 

"I need to get some clothes. Hopefully, one of the football players has a change of clothes for after 
practice." 

We start walking through the woods. I'm going to circle around and look inside people's cars for 
something to wear. 

"What just happened, John? What is happening?" 
"You were in a fire, and I got you out of it." 
"What you did isn't possible." 
"It is for me." 

"What's that supposed to mean?" 



I look at her. I had hoped never to hav e to tell her what I'm about to tell her. Even though I knew it 
probably wasn't realistic, I had hoped to stay hidden in Paradise. Henri has always said never to get too 
close to anyone. Because if you do, at some point they're going to notice that you're different, and that 
will require an explanation. And that means we have to leave. My heart is pounding, my hands are 
shaking, but not because I'm cold. If I have any hope of staying, or of getting away with what I did 
tonight, I have to tell her. 

"I am not who you think I am," I say. 

"Who are you?" 

"I am Number Four." 

"What's that supposed to mean?" 

"Sarah, it's going to sound stupid and crazy, but what I'm about to say is the truth. You have to believe 
me." 

She touches her hand to the side of my face. "If you say it's the truth, then I'll believe you." 
"It is." 

"Then tell me." 

"I'm an alien. I am the fourth of nine kids sent to Earth after our planet was destroyed. I have powers, 



powers unlike any human, powers that allow me to do things like I did in the house. And there are other 
aliens here on Earth who are hunting me, the ones who attacked my planet, and if they find me they will 
kill me." 



I expect her to slap me, or laugh at me, or scream, or turn and run away from me. She stops and looks 
at me. Looks right into my eyes. 

"You're telling me the truth," she says. 

"Yes, I am." I look into her eyes, willing her to believe me. She stares searchingly at me for a long 
moment, and then nods. 

"Thank you for saving my life. I don't care what you are or where you're from. To me you're John, the 
boy I love." 

"What?" 

"I love you, John, and you saved my life, and that's all that's important. " 



"I love you too. And I always will." 

I wrap my arms around her and kiss her. After a minute or so, she pulls away. 
"Let's go find you some clothes and get back so people know we're okay." 



Sarah finds a change of clothes in the fourth car we check. They're close enough to what I was 
wearingâ€”jeans and a button-down shirtâ€”that no one will notice the difference. When we reach the 
house we stand as far away as possible while still being able to see. The house has collapsed in on itself 
and is now nothing more than a twisted heap of blackened coals soggy with water. Wisps of smoke 
sporadically rise, looking ghastly in the night sky. There are three fire trucks. I count six cop cars. Nine 
sets of flashing lights but no sound to go with them. Few people, if any, have left. They've been pushed 
back, the house cordoned off with yellow tape. The police officers are questioning some of them. Five 
firemen stand in the middle of it all, sifting through the rubble. 

Then I hear "There they are!" yelled from behind me. Every set of eyes in the crowd turns my way. It 
takes me a full five seconds to realize that it is me the person is referring to. 

Four police officers walk towards us. Behind them is a man holding a notepad and tape recorder. While 
we were looking for the clothes, Sarah and I agreed on a story. I came around the back of the house 
where she was watching the fire. She had jumped out of the second-floor window with the dogs, who 
had run away. We had watched away from the crowd, but ev entually drifted over and joined it. I 



explained to her that we couldn't tell anyone about what happened, not even Sam or Henri, that if 
anyone 

found out the truth, I would have to leave immediately. We agreed that I would answer the questions 
and 

she would agree with whatever I said. 

"Are you John Smith?" one of the cops asks me. The officer is of medium height, and stands with his 

shoulders hunched. He isn't overweight but is far from being in shape, with a slight paunch and an 
overall 

look of softness. 



"Yes, why?" 

"Two people said they saw you run into that house and then come flying out the back of it like 
Superman, with the dogs and the girl in your arms." 

"Seriously?" I ask in disbelief. Sarah stays beside me. 

"That's what they said." 

I fake a laugh. "The house was on fire. Do I look like I was inside a burning house?" 



He scrunches his eyebrows together and rests his hands on his hips. "So you're telling me you didn't go 
in there?" 



"I came around the back to try and find Sarah," I say. "She had gotten out with the dogs. We stayed 
back there and watched the fire and then came over here." 

The officer looks at Sarah. "Is that true?" 

"Yes." 

"Well, who ran into that house, then?" the reporter beside him chimes in. It's his first time speaking. He 
watches me with shrewd, judging eyes. I can already tell that he doesn't believe my story. 

"How do I know?" I say. 

He nods his head and writes something in his notebook. I can't read what it says. 
"So you're telling me these two witnesses are liars?" the reporter asks. 
"Baines," the officer says, shaking his head at him. 

I nod. "I didn't go into the house and save her or the dogs. They were outside." 
"Who said anything about saving her or the dogs?" Baines asks. 



I shrug. "I thought that's what you were implying. 



"I didn't imply anything. " 



Sam walks up with my phone. I try to fix him with a stare to tell him the timing is bad, but he doesn't 
understand and he hands me my phone anyway. 



"Thanks," I say. 



"I'm happy you're okay," he says. The officers glare at him and he slinks away. 



Baines watches with his eyes squinted. He's chewing gum, trying to piece the information together. He 
nods to himself. 



"So you handed your phone to your friend before you went for a walk?" he asks. 



"I handed him my phone during the party. It was uncomfortable in my pocket. 



"I bet it was," Baines says. "So where did you go?" 

"All right, Baines, that's enough questions," the officer says. 

"Can I leave?" I ask him. He nods his head. I walk away with my phone in my hand, dialing Henri's 
number with Sarah at my side. 

"Hello," answers Henri. 

"I'm ready to be picked up," I say. "There's been a terrible fire here." 
"What?" 

"Can you just pick us up?" 
"Yes. I'll be right there." 

"So how do you explain the cut on the top of your head?" Baines asks from behind me. He had been 
following me, listening to my call to Henri. 

"I cut it on a branch in the woods." 

"How convenient," he says, and again writes something in his notebook. "You know I can tell when I'm 
being lied to, right?" 



I ignore him, keep walking away with Sarah's hand in mine. We head over to Sam. 
"I'll find the truth, Mr. Smith. I always do," Baines yells behind me. 
"Henri is on the way," I say to Sam and Sarah. 
"What the hell was that all about?" Sam asks. 

"Who knows? Somebody thinks they saw me run in, probably somebody who drank too much," I say 
more at Baines than Sam. 

We stand at the end of the driveway until Henri arrives. When he pulls up he steps out of the truck and 
looks at the smoldering house far off in the distance. 

"Ah, hell. Promise me you weren't a part of this," he says. 

"I wasn't," I say. 

We get into the truck. He pulls away while looking at the smoking rubble. 
"You guys smell like smoke," Henri says. 

None of us reply, making the drive in silence. Sarah sits on my lap. We drop Sam off first, then Henri 



pulls out of the driveway and points the truck towards Sarah's home. 
"I don't want to leave you tonight," Sarah says to me. 
"I don't want to leave you either." 

When we arrive at her house I get out with her and walk her to the door. She won't let go of me when I 
hug her good night. 

"Will you call me when you get home?" 

"Of course." 

"I love you." 

I smile. "I love you too." 

She goes inside. I walk back to the truck, where Henri is waiting. I have to figure out a way to keep him 

from finding out the truth about tonight, from making us leave Paradise. Henri pulls out and drives 
home. 



"So what happened to your jacket?" he asks. 

"It was in Mark's closet." 

"What happened to your head?" 

"I hit it trying to get out when the fire first started." 

He looks over at me doubtfully. "You're the one who smells like smoke." 

I shrug. "There was a lot of it." 

"So what started it?" 

"Drunkenness is my guess." 

Henri nods and turns down our road. 

"Well," he says. "It will be interesting to see what's in the papers on Monday." He turns and looks at 
me, studying my reaction. 

I keep silent. 

Yes,I think,it most certainly will be. 



CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN 

I CAN'T SLEEP. I LIE IN BED STARING THROUGHthe darkness at the ceiling. I call Sarah and 



we talk until three; I hang up and lie there with my eyes wide-open. At four I crawl out of bed and walk 
out of the room. Henri sits at the kitchen table, drinking coffee. He looks up at me, bags beneath his 
eyes, hair tousled. 

"What are you doing?" I ask. 

"I couldn't sleep either," he says. "Scouring the news." 
"Find anything?" 

"Yes, but I'm not sure what it means to us yet. The men who wrote and publishedThey Walk Among Us 
, the men we met, were tortured and killed." 



I sit across from him. "What?" 

"Police found them when the neighbors called after hearing screams coming from the house." 
"They didn't know where we lived. " 

"No, they didn't. Thankfully. But it means the Mogadorians are getting bolder. And they're close. If we 
see or hear anything else out of the ordinary, we're going to need to leave immediately, no questions 
asked, no discussion." 

"Okay." 

"How's your head?" 

"Sore," I say. It took seven stitches to close the cut. Henri did it himself. I'm wearing a baggy sweatshirt. 
I'm certain one of the cuts on my back needs stitches as well, but that would require me to take my shirt 
off, and how would I explain the other cuts and scrapes to Henri? He'll know for sure what has 
happened. My lungs still burn. If anything, the pain has grown worse. 

"So, the fire started in the basement?" 

"Yes." 



"And you were in the living room?" 



"Yes." 



"How did you know it started in the basement?" 



"Because all the guys came running up." 



"And you knew everyone was out of the house by the time you went outside?" 



"Yes." 



"How?" 



I can tell he's trying to get me to contradict myself, that he's skeptical of my story. I'm certain he doesn't 



believe that I merely stood out front watching like everyone else. 



"I didn't go in," I say. It pains me to do so, but I look him in the eye and I lie. 



"I believe you," he says. 



I wake close to noon. Birds are chirping beyond the window, and sunlight is pouring in. I breathe a sigh 

of relief. The fact that I was allowed to sleep this late means that there was no news to incriminate me. 
If 

there had been, I would have been pulled from bed and told to pack. 

I roll off my back and that's when the pain hits. My chest feels as though somebody is pushing down on 
it, squeezing me. I can't take full breaths. When I try there is a sharp pain. It scares me. 

Bernie Kosar is snoring in a ball at my side. I wake him by wrestling with him. He groans at first, then 
wrestles back. That is the beginning to our day. Me rousing the snoring dog beside me. His wagging tail, 

his dangling tongue immediately make me feel better. Never mind the pain in my chest. Never mind 
what 

the day might bring. 

Henri's truck is gone. On the table is a note that reads: "Ran to the store. Be back at one." I walk 
outside. I have a headache and my arms are red and splotchy, the cuts slightly raised as though I've been 
scratched by a cat. I don't care about the cuts, or my headache, or the burning in my chest. What I care 
about is that I'm still here, in Ohio, that tomorrow I'll be going back to the same school I've gone to for 
three months now, and that I will see Sarah tonight. 



Henri gets home at one. There is a haggard look in his eyes that tells me he still hasn't slept. After he 
unloads the groceries he goes into his bedroom and closes the door. Bernie Kosar and I go for a walk in 
the woods. I try to run, and I'm able to for a little while, but after a half mile or so the pain is too great 
and I have to stop. We walk on for what must be five miles. The woods end at another country road that 
looks similar to ours. I turn around and walk back. Henri is still in his room with the door closed when I 
return. I sit on the porch. I tense every time a car passes. I keep thinking one of them will stop, but none 
of them do. 

The confidence I felt when I woke up is slowly chipped away as the day wanes. TheParadise Gazette 
isn't printed on Sunday. Will there be a story tomorrow? I suppose I expected a call to arrive, or the 
same reporter to show up at our doorstep, or one of the officers to ask more questions. I don't know 
why I'm so worried about a small-time reporter, but he'd been persistentâ€”too persistent. And I know 
he didn't believe my story. 

But nobody comes to our house. No one calls. I expected something, and when that something doesn't 
come, a dread creeps in that I'm about to be exposed. "I'll find the truth, Mr. Smith. I always do," 
Baines said. I consider running into town, trying to find him to dissuade him from any such truth, but I 
know that would only encourage suspicion. All I can do is hold my breath and hope for the best. 

I wasn't in that house. 



I have nothing to hide. 



Sarah comes over that night. We go to my room and I hold her in my arms, lying on my back on the 
bed. Her head is against my chest and her leg is draped over me. She asks me questions about who I 
am, my past, about Lorien, about the Mogadorians. I'm still amazed at how quickly, and easily, Sarah 
believed everything, and how she's accepted it. I answ er everything truthfully, which feels good after all 
the lies I've told over the last few days. But when we talk about the Mogadorians, I start to get scared. 
I'm worried that they'll find us. That what I did will expose us. I would do it again, for if I didn't Sarah 
would be dead, but I'm scared. I'm also scared of what Henri is going to do if he finds out. Though he is 
not biologically, for all intents and purposes he is my father. I love him and he loves me and I don't want 
to disappoint him. And as we lie there, my fear begins to reach new levels. I can't take not knowing what 
the next day will bringâ€”the uncertainty is sawing me in two. The room is dark. A flickering candle burns 
on the window ledge a few feet away. I take a deep breath, which is to say, as deep a breath as lean 
take. 

"Are you okay?" Sarah asks. 

I wrap my arms around her. "I miss you," I say. 

"You miss me? But I'm right here." 

"That's the worst way to miss somebody. When they're right beside you and you miss them anyway." 



"You're talking crazy. She reaches up and pulls my face to hers and kisses me, her soft lips on mine. I 
don't want her to stop. I don't ever want her to stop kissing me. As long as she is, then everything is fine. 
Everything is right. I would stay in this room forev er if I could. The world can pass by without me, 
without us. Just as long as we can stay here, together, in each other's arms. 

"Tomorrow," I say. 

She looks up at me. "Tomorrow, what?" 

I shake my head. "I don't really know," I say. "I guess I'm just scared." 
She flashes a confused look at me. "Scared of what?" 
"I don't know," I say. "Just scared." 



When Henri and I get home after dropping her off I go back into my bedroom and lie in the same spot 
where she was. I can still smell her on my bed. I won't sleep tonight. I won't even try. I pace the room. 
When Henri goes to bed I walk out and sit at the kitchen table and write under candlelight. I write about 
Lorien, about Florida, about the things that I've seen when our training first beganâ€”the war, the animals, 
childhood images. I hope for some sort of cathartic release, but there isn't one. It only makes me sadder. 

When my hand cramps I walk out of the house and stand on the porch. The cold air helps ease the pain 
of breathing. The moon is nearly full, a side of it ever so subtly shaved away. Sunrise is two hours away, 



and with that sunrise comes a new day, and the news of the weekend. The paper falls on our doorstep 
at 

six, sometimes six thirty. I'll already be at the school by the time it arrives and, if I'm in the news, I refuse 
to leave without seeing Sarah again, without saying good-bye to Sam. 



I walk into the house, change clothes, and pack my bag. I tiptoe back through and quietly close the door 

behind me. I take three steps on the porch when I hear a scratching at the door. I turn around and open 
it 

and Bernie Kosar comes trotting out.Okay, I think,let us go together. 

We walk, stopping often, standing and listening to the silence. The night is dark but after a while a pale 

glow grows in the eastern sky just as we enter the school grounds. There are no cars in the lot and all 
the 

lights are off inside. At the very front of the school, in front of the pirate mural, sits a large rock that has 

been painted by previous graduating classes. I sit on it. Bernie Kosar lies in the grass a few feet away 

from me. I'm there for half an hour before the first vehicle arrives, a van, and I assume it's Hobbs, the 

janitor, arriving early to get the school in order, but I'm wrong. The van pulls up to the front doors and 

the driver gets out and leaves it idling. He's carrying a stack of newspapers bound by wire. We nod at 

each other and he drops the stack by the door and then drives off. I stay on the rock. I glance 

contemptuously at the papers. In my mind I'm hurling curses at them, threatening them to deliver the 
bad 



news I'm terrified of. 

"I wasn't in that house on Saturday," I say out loud, and as soon as I do I feel stupid. Then I look away, 
sigh, and jump off the rock. 

"Well," I say to Bernie Kosar. "This is it, for good or bad." 

He opens his eyes briefly, then closes them and resumes his nap on the cold ground. 

I tear the binding away and lift the top paper. The story has made the front page. At the very top is a 
picture of the burned rubble taken the next morning at dawn. There is a gothic, foreboding feel to it. 
Blackened ash is forefront to naked trees and frost-covered grass. I read the headline: 



JAMESHOUSEGOESUP IN SMOKE 



I hold my breath, a miserable feeling centered in my gut as though horrible news is about to find me. I 
race through the article. I don't read it, only look for my name. I reach the end. I blink my eyes and 
shake my head to rid myself of the cobwebs. A cautious smile forms. Then I scan through it again. 

"No way," I say. "Bernie Kosar, my name isn't here!" 



He pays me no attention. I run across the grass and jump back on the rock. 
"My name isn't here!" I yell again, this time as loudly as I can. 

I sit back down and read the story. The headline is a play on Cheech and Chong'sUp in Smoke , which 
is apparently a movie about drugs. What the police believe started the blaze was a marijuana joint being 
smoked in the basement. How that information was discovered, I have no idea, especially because it is 
so wrong. The article itself is callous and mean, almost an attack on the James family. I didn't like the 
reporter. It's apparent that he doesn't like the Jameses. Who knows why? 

I sit on the rock and read the article three times before the first person arrives to unlock the doors. I 
can't stop smiling. I'm staying in Ohio, in Paradise. The town name doesn't seem so foolish to me 



anymore. Through my excitement I feel as though I'm overlooking something, that I've forgotten a key 
component. But I'm so happy that I don't care. What harm can come now? My name isn't in the article. 
I didn't run into that house. The proof is right here, in my hands. Nobody can say otherwise. 



"What are you so happy about?" Sam asks in astronomy class. I haven't stopped smiling. 
"Didn't you read the paper this morning?" 
He nods. 

"Sam, I wasn't in it! I don't have to leave." 
"Why would they put you in the paper?" he asks. 

I'm dumbfounded. I open my mouth to argue with him but just then Sarah walks into the room. She 
comes sauntering up the aisle. 

"Hey, gorgeous," I say. 

She bends down and kisses me on the cheek, something I'll never take for granted. 

"Somebody's in a happy mood today," she says. 

"Happy to see you," I say. "Nervous about your driver's test?" 

"Maybe a little. Just can't wait until it's over." 

She sits down beside me. This is my day, I think.This is where I want to be and this is where I am. Sarah 
on one side, Sam on the other. 



I go to class as I've done all the other days. I sit with Sam at lunch. We don't talk about the fire. We 

must be the only two in the whole school not talking about it. The same story, over and over. I nev er 
hear 

my name spoken once. As I expected, Mark isn't in school. A rumor spreads that he and several of the 
others will be suspended for the theory the paper has spouted. I don't know if it's true or not. I don't 
know if I care. 

By the time Sarah and I enter the kitchen for eighth-period home ec, my certainty that I'm safe has 
taken 

a firm hold. Such a strong certainty that I'm confident I must be wrong, that something has been 
overlooked. The doubt has been creeping up throughout the day but I've been quick to push it back 
down. 

We make tapioca pudding. An easy day. In the middle of class, the kitchen door opens. It's the hall 

monitor. I look at him and I know immediately what it means. The harbinger of bad news. The 
messenger 

of death. He walks straight up to me and hands me a slip of paper. 
"Mr. Harris wants to see you," he says. 



"Now?" 



He nods. 



I look at Sarah and shrug. I don't want her to see my fear. I smile at her and walk to the door. Before I 

leave I turn around and look at her again. She's bent over the table mixing our ingredients, wearing the 

same green apron that I tied on her my first day, the day we made pancakes and ate them off the same 

plate. Her hair is in a ponytail and loose strands dangle in front of her face. She tucks them behind her 
ear 

and as she does she sees me standing in the doorway watching her. I keep staring, trying to remember 

every minute detail of this moment, the way she grips the wooden spoon in her hand, the ivory look to 

her skin with the light coming in the windows behind her, the tenderness in her eyes. Her shirt has a 
loose 

button at the collar. I wonder if she knows about it. Then the hall monitor says something behind me. I 
wave at Sarah, shut the door, and walk down the hall. I take my time, trying to convince myself that it's 
just a formality, some document we forgot to sign, some question about transcripts. But I know it's not 
just a formality. 

Mr. Harris sits at his desk when I enter the office. He is smiling in a way that terrifies me, the same 
prideful smile that he had on the day he pulled Mark from class to do the interview. 

"Sit down," he says. I sit. "So, is it true?" he asks. He glances at his computer screen, then he looks 
back at me. 



"Is what true?" 



On his desk there is an envelope with my name handwritten in black ink. He sees me looking at it. 
"Oh yes, this was faxed to you about half an hour ago." 
He picks the envelope up and tosses it to me. I catch it. 
"What is it?" I ask. 

"No idea. My secretary sealed it in the envelope as soon as it arrived." 

Several things happen at once. I open the envelope and remove its contents. Two sheets of paper. The 
top is a cover page with my name on it and "CONFIDENTIAL" written in large black letters. I shuffle it 
behind the second sheet. A single sentence written in all capitals. No name. Just four black words on a 
white canvas. 

"So, Mr. Smith, is it true? Did you run into that burning house to save Sarah Hart and those dogs?" Mr. 
Harris asks. Blood rushes to my face. I look up. He turns his computer monitor towards me so that I can 
read the screen. It's the blog affiliated with theParadise Gazette . I don't need to look at the name of the 
author to know who has written it. The title is more than enough. 



THEJAMESHOUSEFTRE: THEUNTOLDSTORY 



My breath catches in my throat. My heart races. The world stops, or at least it seems to. I feel dead 
inside. I look back down at the sheet of paper I'm holding. White paper, smooth in my fingertips. It 
reads: 



ARE YOU NUMBER 4? 



Both sheets fall from my hands, drift away, and float to the floor, where they lie motionless. I don't 
understand, I think. How can this be? 



"So is it?" Mr. Harris asks. 



My mouth drops open. Mr. Harris is smiling, proud, happy. But it's not him that I see. It's what's behind 
him, seen through the windows of his office. A blur of red coming around the corner, moving faster than 
what is normal, than what is safe. The squeal of tires as it zips into the lot. The pickup truck throwing 
gravel as it makes a second turn. Henri leaning over the wheel like some crazed maniac. He hits the 
brakes so forcefully that his whole body jerks and the truck comes screeching to a stop. 



I close my eyes. 



I place my head in my hands. 



Through the window I hear the truck door open. I hear it close. 



Henri will be in this office within the minute. 



CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT 

"ARE YOU OKAY, MR. SMITH?" THE PRINCIPALasks. I look up at him. He attempts his best 
look of concern, a look that lasts only a second before the toothy grin returns to his face. 

"No, Mr. Harris," I say. "I'm not okay." 

I pick the sheet up off the floor. I read it again. Where did it come from? Are they merely screwing with 
us now? There is no phone number or address, no name. Nothing but four words and a question mark. I 
look up and out the window. Henri's truck is parked, fumes rising from the exhaust. In and out as quickly 
as he can. I look back at the computer screen. The article was posted at 1 1:59 a.m., almost two hours 
ago. I'm amazed it took Henri this long to arrive. A sense of vertigo seeps in. I feel myself sway. 



"Do you need the nurse?" Mr. Harris asks. 



The nurse,I think.No, I don't need the nurse. The nurse's station is the room beside the home economics 
kitchen. What I need, Mr. Harris, is to go back there, fifteen minutes ago, before the hall monitor arrived. 
Sarah must have the pudding on the stove by now. I wonder if it's boiling yet. Is she looking towards the 
door, waiting for me to return? 

The faint echo of the school doors slamming shut reaches the principal's office. Fifteen seconds until 
Henri is here. Then to his truck. Then home. Then where? To Maine? Missouri? Canada? A different 



school, a new beginning, another new name. 

I haven't slept in almost thirty hours and only now do I feel the exhaustion. But then something else 

enters with it, and in that split second between instinct and action, the reality that I'm going away 
forev er 

without the chance to say good-bye is suddenly too much to bear. My eyes narrow, my face twists in 
agony, andâ€”without thinking, without truly knowing what it is that I'm doingâ€” I lunge over Mr. Harris's 
desk and crash through the plate-glass window, which shatters into a million little pieces behind me. A 
scream of shock follows. 



My feet land in the outside grass. I turn right and run across the schoolyard, the classrooms passing in a 

blur to my right, across the lot and into the woods that lie beyond the baseball field. There are cuts on 
my 

forehead and left elbow from the glass. My lungs are burning. The hell with the pain. I keep going, the 
sheet of paper still in my right hand. I shove it into my pocket. Why would the Mogadorians send a fax? 
Wouldn't they just show up? That is their main advantage, to arrive unexpectedly, without warning. The 
benefit of surprise. 

I take a hard left in the middle of the woods, weaving in and out of the forest's density until it ends and 
a 

field begins. Cows chewing cud watch with blank eyes as I streak past. I beat Henri to the house. Bernie 

Kosar is nowhere to be seen. I burst through the door and stop dead in my tracks. My breath catches in 

my throat. At the kitchen table, in front of Henri's open laptop, sits a person I immediately think is one 
of 

them. They've beat me here, have worked it out so that I am alone, without Henri. Th e person turns 
around and I clench my hands into fists and am ready to fight. 

But it's Mark James. 

"What are you doing here?" I ask. 

"I'm trying to figure out what's going on," he says, a look of fright evident in his eyes. "Who the hellare 
you?" 

"What are you talking about?" 



"Look," he says, pointing to the computer screen. 



I walk to him, but I don't look at the screen, my eyes instead focusing on the white sheet of paper sitting 

beside the computer. It's an exact replica of the sheet in my pocket except for the paper that it's printed 

on, which is thicker than the fax. And then I notice something else. At the bottom of Henri's, in very 
small 

handwriting, is a phone number. Surely they can't expect us to call? "Yes, it's me, Number Four. I am 
here waiting for you. We'v e been running for ten years, but please, come kill us now; we won't put up a 
fight." It makes no sense at all. 

"Is this yours?" I ask. 

"No," he says. "But it was delivered by UPS at the same time that I got here. Your dad read it as I 
showed him the video, and then he sprinted out of the house." 

"What video?" I ask. 

"Watch," he says. 



I look at the computer and see that he's pulled up YouTube. He presses the play button. It's a grainy 



video, of poor quality as though it has been shot on somebody's cell phone. I recognize his house 
immediately, the front of which is in flames. The camera is shaky, but through it can be heard the dogs 
bark and the filtered gasps throughout the crowd. Then the person begins walking away from the crowd, 
to the side of the house, and eventually to the back. The camera zooms in to the rear window where the 
bark is coming from. The bark stops and I close my eyes because I know what is coming. About twenty 
seconds pass, and in the moment that I fly through the window with Sarah in one arm and the dog in the 
other, Mark hits the pause button on the video. The camera is zoomed in, and our faces are 
unmistakable. 

"Who are you?" Mark asks. 

I ignore his question, instead ask one of my own: "Who took this?" 
"I have no idea," he answers. 

The gravel pops beneath the truck tires in the front of the house as Henri pulls in. I stand straight and 
my 

first instinct is to run, get out of the house and get back to the school, where I know Sarah will be staying 
late to dev elop photosâ€”until her driver's test at four thirty. Her face is just as obvious as mine is in that 

video, which puts her in as much danger as me. But something keeps me from fleeing, and I instead 
move 

around to the other side of the table and wait. The truck door slams shut. Henri walks into the house 
five 

seconds later, Bernie Kosar dashing in ahead of him. 

"You lied to me," he says in the doorway, his face set hard, the muscles in his jaw flexed. 



"I lie to everybody," I say. "I learned that from you." 
"We don't lie to each other!" he screams. 
Our eyes stay locked. 
"What's going on?" Mark asks. 

"I'm not leaving without finding Sarah," I say. "She's in danger, Henri!" 

He shakes his head at me. "Now isn't the time for sentimentality, John. Do you not see this?" he says, 
and walks across the room and lifts the sheet of paper and begins waving it at me. "Where the hell do 
you think this came from?" 

"What in the hell is going on?" Mark nearly bellows. 

I ignore the sheet and Mark, and keep my eyes on Henri's. "Yes, I've seen it, and that's why I need to 
get back to the school. They'll see her and go after her. " 

Henri starts towards me. After his second step I lift my hand and stop him where he stands, ten or so 
feet away. He tries to keep walking but I hold him in place. 

"We need to get out of here, John," he says, a hurt, almost pleading tone in his voice. 

While holding him at a distance, I begin walking backwards towards my bedroom. He stops trying to 



walk. He says nothing, standing there watching me with pain in his eyes, a look that makes me feel 
worse 

than I've ever felt before. I have to look away. When I get to my doorway our eyes meet again. His 



shoulders are slumped, arms at his sides as though he doesn't know what to do with himself. He just 
stares at me, looking as though he may cry. 

"I'm sorry," I say, giv ing myself enough of a head start to get away, and turn and sprint across my 

bedroom, grab from my drawer a knife I used to scale fish when we still lived in Florida, and jump out 

the window and race into the woods. Bernie Kosar's bark follows, nothing else. I run for a mile and stop 

in the big clearing where Sarah and I made snow angels. Our clearing, she had called it. The clearing in 

which we would have our summer picnics. A pain in my chest at the thought that I won't be here for 

summer, a pain so great that I bend over and grit my teeth. If only I could call her and warn her to get 
out 

of the school. My phone, along with everything else I took to school, is in my locker. I'll get her out of 
harm's way and then I'll get back to Henri and we'll leave. 

I turn and run towards school, run as hard as my lungs will permit me. I reach the school just as the 
buses have begun pulling out of the lot. I watch them from the border of the woods. At the front of the 
school Hobbs is standing outside the front window measuring a large sheet of plywood to cover the 



window I broke. I slow my breathing, try my best to clear my mind. I watch the cars trickle out until 
there are only a few left. Hobbs covers the hole, disappears into the school. I wonder if he has been 
warned about me, if he has been instructed to call the police if he sees me. I look at my watch. Though it 
is only 3:30, the darkness seems to have come on faster than normal, a darkness steeped in density, a 
darkness that is heavy, consuming. The lights in the lot have come on, but even they seem dulled and 
stunted. 

I leave the woods and walk across the baseball field and into the lot. Ten or so cars stand alone. The 

door to the school is already locked. I grab hold of it and close my eyes and focus and the lock clicks. I 

walk inside, and I don't see anyone. Only half of the hallway lights are on. The air is still and quiet. 

Somewhere I hear the floor polisher running. I turn into the lobby and the door to the photography 

darkroom comes into view. Sarah. She was going to develop some pictures today before her test. I pass 

by my locker and open it. My phone isn't there; the locker is completely empty. Somebody, hopefully 

Henri, has it. By the time I reach the darkroom I hav en't seen a single person. Where are the athletes, 
the 

members of the band, the teachers who often stay late to grade papers or do whatever it is they do? A 

bad feeling creeps into my bones, and I'm terrified that something awful has already happened to Sarah. 
I 

press my ear against the darkroom door to listen, but hear nothing aside from the drone of the floor 
polisher coming from far down the hallway. I take a deep breath and try the door. It's locked. I press my 
ear to it again and gently knock. There's no answer, but I hear a slight rustling on the other side. I take a 
deep breath, tense myself to what I might find inside, and unlock the door. 

The room is pitch-black. I turn on my lights and sweep my hands one way, then the other. I see nothing 
and think the room is empty, but in the corner, I see a very slight movement. I crouch down to look, and 
beneath the counter, trying to remain unseen, is Sarah. I dim my lights so that she can see it's me. From 



the shadows, she looks up and smiles, and breathes a sigh of relief. 

"They're here, aren't they?" 

"If they aren't yet, they will be soon." 

I help her up from off the floor and she wraps her arms around me and squeezes me so tightly that I 
don't think she intends to ever let go. 

"I came in here right after eighth period, and as soon as school ended, all these weird noises started 
coming from the halls. And it got really dark, so I locked myself in here and stayed beneath the counter, 
too scared to move. I just knew something was wrong, especially after I heard about you jumping 



through the window and you weren't answering your phone." 
"That was smart, but now we have to get out of here, and fast." 

We leave the room, holding hands. The hallway lights flicker off, the whole school engulfed in darkness, 
even though dusk is still an hour or so away. After about ten seconds, they come back on. 



"What's happening?" Sarah whispers. 



"I don't know." 

We move down the hallway as quietly as we can, and any noise we do make seems deadened, muffled. 
The quickest way out is the back door that opens onto the teachers' lot, and as we head that way, the 
sound of the floor polisher grows. I assume that we'll run into Hobbs. I assume he knows that I'm the 
one who broke the window. Will he fend me off with a broomstick and call the police? I guess at this 
point it doesn't matter. 

When we reach the back hallway the lights turn off again. We stop and wait for them to come back on, 
but they don't. The floor polisher continues, a steady hum. I can't see it, but it is only twenty or so feet 
away in the impenetrable darkness. I find it odd that the machine keeps running, that Hobbs keeps 
polishing in the dark. I turn on my lights, and Sarah lets go of my hand and stands behind me with her 
hands on my hips. I find the plug in the wall first, then the cord, then the machine itself. It stands in one 
place, bumping against the wall, unmanned, running itself. Panic sweeps through me, with fear close 
behind. Sarah and I have to get out of the school. 

I rip the cord from the outlet and the polisher stops, r eplaced by the soft hum of silence. I turn my lights 
off. Somewhere far down the hall a door slowly creaks open. I crouch down, my back against the wall, 
Sarah holding tightly to my arm. Both of us are too scared to say a word. Instinct caused me to pull the 
cord to stop the polisher, and I have the urge to plug it back in, but I know it'll give us away if they're 
here. I close my eyes and strain to listen. The creaking door stops. A soft wind seems to materialize from 
nowhere. Surely there isn't a window open. I think that maybe the wind is entering from the window I 



broke. Then the door slams shut and glass breaks and shatters on the floor. 

Sarah screams. Something sweeps by us but I don't see what it is and I don't care to find out. I pull 
Sarah by the hand and sprint down the hall. I shoulder the door and rush out into the parking lot. Sarah 
gasps and both of us stop dead in our tracks. My breath catches in my throat and chills shoot up my 
spine. The lights are still on but dimmed and looking ghastly in the heavy dark. Beneath the nearest light 
we both see it, trench coat swaying in the breeze, hat pulled low so that I can't see its eyes. It lifts his 
head and grins at me. 

Sarah's grip tightens on my hand. We both take one step backwards and trip in our rush to get away. 
We move the rest of the way back in a crab walk until we hit the door. 

"Come on," I yell as I rush to my feet. Sarah stands. I try the latch but the door automatically locked 
behind us. 

"Shit!" I yell. 

I see another in the corner of my eye, standing still at first. I watch as it takes its first step towards me. 
There is another one behind it. The Mogadorians. All these years and they are finally here. I try to focus 

but my hands are shaking too badly to open the door. I feel them bearing down, closing in. Sarah 
presses 



close to me and I can feel her trembling. 



I can't focus to get the door unlocked. What happened to grace under pressure, to all those days of 
training in the backyard?! don't want to die, I think.I don't want to die. 

"John," Sarah says, and in her voice there is such fear that it causes my eyes to open wide, and twist in 
determination. 

The lock clicks. The door opens. Sarah and I push through and I slam it shut. There is a thud on the 
other side as though one of them has kicked it. We run down the hall. Noises follow. I don't know if any 
of the Mogadorians are in the school. Another window breaks off to the side and Sarah screams in 
surprise. 

"We have to be quiet," I say. 

We try opening classroom doors but all of them are locked. I don't think there is enough time for me to 

open one of them. Somewhere a door is slammed shut and I can't tell if it was ahead of us or behind us. 

Noises follow close behind, closing in, filling our ears. Sarah takes my hand and we run faster, my mind 

rushing ahead to remember the layout of the building so I can keep my lights off, keep from being seen. 

Finally a door opens and we fall headlong into it. It's the history classroom, at the left of the school 

overlooking a slight hill, and because of the twenty-foot drop, there are bars over the windows. 
Darkness 

is pressing firmly against the glass and no light enters. I silently shut the door and hope they didn't see 
us. 



I sweep my lights across the room and quickly turn them off. We're alone and we hide beneath the 
teacher's desk. I try to catch my breath. Sweat runs down the sides of my face and stings my eyes. How 
many of them are here? I saw at least three. Surely those aren't the only ones out there. Did they bring 
the beasts with them, the small weasels that the writers in Athens were so scared of? I wish that Henri 
were here, or even Bernie Kosar. 

The door slowly opens. I hold my breath, listening. Sarah leans into me and we put our arms around 
each other. The door closes very quietly and clicks into place. No footsteps follow. Did they merely 

open the door and stick their heads in to see if we were inside? Did they move on without entering? 
They 

found me after all this time; surely they aren't that lazy. 

"What are we going to do?" Sarah whispers after thirty seconds. 

"I don't know," I whisper back. 

The room is wrapped in silence. Whatever opened the door must have left, or is out in the hall waiting. I 
know, though, the longer we sit, the more of them will arrive. We need to get out of here. We'll have to 
risk it. I take a deep breath. 

"We have to leave," I whisper. "We're not safe here." 
"But they're out there." 

"I know, and they aren't going to leave. Henri is at home, and is in just as much danger as we are." 



"But how are we going to get out?" 

I have no idea, don't know what to say. Only one way out and that's the way we came in. Sarah's arms 
stay around me. 



"We're sitting ducks, Sarah. They'll find us, and when they do, it will be with all of them. At least we'll 
have the element of surprise this way. If we can get out of the school, I think I can start a car. If I can't, 
we'll have to fight our way back." 

She nods in agreement. 

I take a deep breath and move out from underneath the desk. I reach for Sarah's hand and she stands 

with me. Together we take one step, quietly as possible. Then another. It takes a full minute to cross the 

room and nothing meets us in the darkness. A very slight glow comes from my hands, emitting almost 
no 

light, only enough to keep from running into a desk. I stare at the door. I'll open it and hav e Sarah jump 
on my back and I'll run as hard and as fast as I can, lights on, down the hall, out of the school and into 

the lot or , failing that, into the woods. I know the woods and the way home. There are more of them, 
but 

Sarah and I will have the home -field advantage. 



As we near the door, I can feel my heart pounding so hard that I fear the Mogadorians can hear it. I 
close my eyes and slowly reach for the knob. Sarah tenses, gripping my hand as tightly as she can. When 
my hand is an inch away, so close to the knob that I can feel the cold coming off of it, we are both 
grabbed from behind and pulled to the ground. 

I try to scream but a hand covers my mouth. Fear rushes through me. I can feel Sarah struggling 
beneath 

the grip and I do the same thing but the grip is too strong. I never anticipated this, the Mogadorians 
being 

stronger than I am. I've greatly underestimated them. There is no hope now. I've failed. I have failed 
Sarah and Henri and I'm sorry.Henri, I hope you put up a better fight than I did. 

Sarah is breathing heavily and with all my might I try to free myself but I can't. 

"Shhh, stop struggling," the voice whispers in my ear. A girl's voice. "They're out there waiting. Both of 
you have to be quiet." 

It's a girl, every bit as strong as I am, maybe even stronger. I don't understand. Her grip loosens and I 
turn and face her. We take each other in. Above the glow of my hands I see a face slightly older than 
mine. Hazel eyes, high cheekbones, long dark hair pulled into a ponytail, a wide mouth and strong nose, 
olive-toned skin. 

"Who are you?" I ask. 



She looks to the door, still silent.An ally, I think. Somebody besides the Mogadorians knows we exist. 



Somebody is here, to help. 

"I am Number Six," she says. "I tried to get here before they did." 



CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE 

"HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?" I ASK. 

She looks to the door. "I've been trying to find you ever since Three was killed. But I'll explain it all 
later. First, we hav e to get out of here." 



"How did you get in without them seeing you?" 



"I can make myself invisible." 



I smile. The same Legacy my grandfather had. Invisibility. The ability to make those things he touches 



invisible as well, like the house on Henri's second day of work. 
"How far do you live from here?" she asks. 
"Three miles." 

I feel her nod through the darkness. 
"Do you have a C pan?" she asks. 
"Yes, of course. Don't you?" 

Her weight shifts and she pauses before speaking, as though drawing strength from some unseen 
entity. 

"I did," she says. "She died three years ago. I've been on my own since then." 
"I'm sorry," I say. 

"It's a war, people are going to die. Right now we have to get out of here or we'll die as well. If they're 

in the area, then they already know where you live, which means they're already there, so it's pointless 
to 

try to be secretive once we're out of here. These are only scouts. The soldiers are on the way. They have 
the swords. The beasts won't be far behind. Time is short. At best we have a day. At worst they're 
already here." 

My first thought:They already know where I live. I panic. Henri is at home, with Bernie Kosar, and the 



soldiers and beasts may already be there. My second thought: her C pan, dead three years now. Six 
has 

been alone that long, alone on a foreign planet since what, the age of thirteen? Fourteen? 

"He's at home," I say. 

"Who?" 

"Henri, my C pan." 

"I'm sure he's fine. They won't touch him as long as you're free. It's you they want, and they'll use him 
to try to lure you," Six says, then lifts her head towards the barred window. We turn and look with her. 
Speeding around the bend coming towards the school, very faintly so that nothing else can be seen, is a 
pair of headlights that slow, pass the exit, then turn into the entrance and quickly disappear. Six turns 
back to us. "All the doors are blocked. How else can we get out?" 

I think about it, figuring that one of the unbarred windows in a different classroom is our best bet. 

"We can get out through the gymnasium," Sarah says. "There's a passageway beneath the stage that 
opens like a cellar door in the back of the school." 



"Really?" I ask. 



She nods, and I feel a sense of pride. 



"Each of you take a hand," Six says. I take her right, Sarah her left. "Be as quiet as possible. As long as 
you hold my hands, you'll both be invisible. They won't be able to see us, but they'll hear us. Once we're 
outside we'll run like hell. We'll never be able to escape them, not since they've found us. The only way 
to escape is to kill them, every last one of them, before the others arrive." 

"Okay," I say. 

"Do you know what that means?" Six says. 

I shake my head. I'm not sure what she is asking me. 

"There's no escaping them now ," she says. "It means you're going to have to fight." 

I mean to respond, but the shuffling I had heard earlier stops outside the door. Silence. Then the 
doorknob is jiggled. Number Six takes a deep breath and lets go of my hand. 

"Never mind sneaking out," she says. "The war starts now." 

She rushes up and thrusts her hands forward and the door breaks away from the jamb and crashes 



across the hallway. Splintered wood. Shattered glass. 
"Turn your lights on!" she yells. 

I snap them on. A Mogadorian stands amid the rubble of the broken door. It smiles, blood seeping from 

the corner of its mouth, where the door has hit it. Black eyes, pale skin as though the sun has never 

touched it. A cave-dwelling creature risen from the dead. It throws something that I don't see and I hear 

Six grunt beside me. I look into its eyes and a pain tears through me so that I'm stuck where I am, unable 

to move. Darkness falls. Sadness. My body stiffens. A haze of pictures of the day of the invasion flicker 

through my mind: the death of women and children, my grandp arents; tears, screams, blood, heaps of 

burning bodies. Six breaks the spell by lifting the Mogadorian in the air and hurling it against the wall. It 

tries standing and Six lifts it again, this time throwing it as hard as she can against one wall and then the 

other. The scout falls to the ground twisted and broken, its chest rising once and then becoming still. 
One 

or two seconds pass. Its entire body collapses into a pile of ash, accompanied by a sound similar to a 
bag of sand being dropped to the ground. 

"What the hell?" I ask, wondering how it's possible for the body to completely disintegrate like it just 
did. 

"Don't look into their eyes!" she yells, ignoring my confusion. 

I think of the writer ofThey Walk Among Us . I now understand what he went through when looking into 
their eyes. I wonder if he welcomed death when the time finally came, welcomed it just to be rid of the 
images that perpetually played in his mind. I can only imagine how intense they would have become had 
Six not broken the spell. 



Two other scouts sweep towards us from the end of the hall. A shroud of darkness surrounds them, as 
though they consume everything around them and tur n it into black. Six stands tall in front of me, firm, 
chin held high. She is two inches shorter than I am, but her presence makes her seem two inches taller. 



Sarah stands behind me. Both Mogadorians stop where the hallway intersects with another, their teeth 
bared in a sneer. My body is tense, muscles burning with exhaustion. They take deep, rasping breaths, 
which is what we heard outside the door, their breathing, not their walking. Watching us. And then a 

different noise fills the hallway, and the Mogadorians both turn their attention to it. A door being 
shaken 

as though somebody is trying to force it open. From out of nowhere there comes the sound of a gun 
blast, followed by the school door being kicked open. They both look surprised, and as they turn to flee, 
two more blasts boom through the hallway and both scouts are blown backwards. We hear the 
approaching sound of two sets of shoes and the click of a dog's toenails. Six tenses beside me, ready for 
whatever is coming our way. Henri! It was his truck's lights we saw enter the school grounds. He has a 
double-barreled shotgun I have never seen before. Bernie Kosar is at his side, and he comes sprinting 
towards me. I crouch down and lift him off the floor. He licks wildly at my face, and I'm so excited to 
see him that I almost forget to tell Six who the man with the shotgun is. 



"It's Henri," I say. "My C pan." 



Henri comes walking down, vigilant, looking at the classroom doors as he passes them, and behind him, 

carrying the Loric Chest in his arms, is Mark. I have no idea why Henri has brought him along. There is a 

crazed look in Henri's eyes, one of exhaustion, full of fear and worry. I expect the worst after the way I 

left the house, some sort of scolding, perhaps a slap across the face, but he instead switches the 
shotgun 

to his left hand and hugs me as tightly as he can. I hug him back. 
"I'm sorry, Henri. I didn't know this would happen." 

"I know you didn't. I'm just happy you're okay." He says, "Come on, we have to get out of here. The 
whole damn school is surrounded." 

Sarah leads us to the safest r oom she can think of, which is the home economics kitchen down the hall. 

We lock the door behind us. Six moves three refrigerators in front of it to keep anything from entering 

while Henri rushes to the windows and pulls the blinds down. Sarah walks straight into the kitchen we 

normally use, opens the drawer, and removes the biggest butcher's knife she can find. Mark watches 
her, 

and when he sees what she has done, he drops the Chest to the floor and grabs a knife of his own. He 

rifles through other drawers and removes a meat-tenderizer hammer and tucks it into the waistband of 
his 

pants. 

"You guys okay?" Henri asks. 



"Yes," I say. 



"Aside from the dagger in my arm, yes, I'm fine," Six says. 

I turn my lights on dimly and look at her arm. She wasn't kidding. Where the biceps meets the shoulder 
a small dagger is sticking out. That was why I heard her gasp before she killed the scout. It had thrown a 
knife at her. Henri reaches up and pulls it free. She grunts. 

"Thankfully it's just a dagger," she says, looking at me. "The soldiers will have swords that glow with 
different sorts of powers." 

I mean to ask what kind of powers, but Henri interrupts. 

"Take this," he says, and holds the shotgun out for Mark to take. He accepts it in his free hand without 

protest, staring in awe at everything he is witnessing around him. I wonder how much Henri has told 
him. 



I wonder why Henri brought him along in the first place. I look back at Six. Henri presses a rag to her 
arm and she holds it in place. He steps over and lifts the Chest and sets it on the nearest table. 



"Here, John," he says. 



Without explanation I help him unlock it. He throws the top open, reaches in, removes a flat rock every 

bit as dark as the aura surrounding the Mogadorians. Six seems to know what the rock is for. She takes 

her shirt off. Beneath it she is wearing a black and gray rubber suit very similar to the silver and blue suit 
I 

saw my father wear in my flashbacks. She takes a deep breath, offers Henri her arm. Henri thrusts the 
rock against the gash, and Six, with her teeth clenched tightly, grunts and writhes in pain. Sweat beads 

across her forehead, her face bright red under the strain, tendons standing out on her neck. Henri holds 
it 

there for nearly a full minute. He pulls the stone away and Six bends over at the waist, taking deep 
breaths to compose herself. I look at her arm. Aside from a bit of blood still glistening, the cut is 
completely healed, no scars, nothing aside from the small tear in the suit. 

"What is that?" I ask, nodding to the rock. 

"It's a healing stone," says Henri. 

"Stuff like that really exists?" 

"On Lorien it does, but the pain of healing is double that of the original pain caused by whatever has 
happened, and the stone only works when the injury was done with the intent to harm or kill. And the 
healing stone has to be used right away." 

"Intent?" I ask. "So, the stone wouldn't work if I tripped and cut my head by accident?" 
"No," Henri says. "That's the whole point of Legacies. Defense and purity." 



"Would it work on Mark or Sarah?" 



"I have no idea," Henri says. "And I hope we don't hav e to find out." 

Six catches her breath. She stands straight, feeling her arm. The red in her face begins to fade. Behind 
her, Bernie Kosar is running back and forth from the blocked door to the windows, which are placed too 

high off the ground for him to see out of, but he stands on his hind legs and tries anyway, growling at 
what 

he feels is out there. Maybe nothing, I think. Occasionally he bites at the air. 
"Did you get my phone today when you were at the school?" I ask Henri. 
"No," he says. "I didn't grab anything." 
"It wasn't there when I went back." 

"Well, it wouldn't work here anyway. They've done something to our house and the school. The power 
is off, and no signals penetrate whatever sort of shield they've set up. All the clocks have stopped. Even 
the air seems dead." 

"We don't have much time," Six interrupts. 

Henri nods. A slight grin appears while he looks at her, a look of pride, maybe even relief. 



"I remember you," he says. 



"I remember you, too." 

Henri reaches out his hand and Six shakes it. "It's shit good to see you again." 

"Damngood," I correct him, but he ignores me. 

"I've been looking for you guys for a while," Six says. 

"Where is Katarina?" Henri asks. 

Six shakes her head. A mournful look crosses her face. 

"She didn't make it. She died three years ago. I've been looking for the others since, you guys 
included." 

"I'm sorry," Henri says. 

Six nods. She looks across the room at Bernie Kosar, who has just begun to growl ferociously. He 
seems to have grown tall enough so that his head is able to peek out the bottom of the window. Henri 



picks the shotgun up off the floor and walks to within five feet of the window. 

"John, turn your lights off," he says. I comply. "Now, on my word, pull the blinds." 

I walk to the side of the window and wrap the cord twice around my hand. I nod to Henri, and over his 
shoulder I see that Sarah has placed her palms against her ears in anticipation of the blast. He cocks the 
shotgun and aims it. 

"It's payback time," he says, then, "Now!" 

I pull the cord and the blind flies up. Henri fires the shotgun. The sound is deafening, echoing in my ears 

for seconds after. He cocks the gun again, keeps it aimed. I twist my body to look out. Two fallen scouts 

are lying in the grass, unmoving. One of them is reduced to ash with the same hollow thud as the one in 

the hallway. Henri shoots the other a second time and it does the same. Shadows seem to swarm 
around 

them. 

"Six, bring a fridge over," Henri says to her. 

Mark and Sarah watch with amazement as the fridge floats in the air towards us and is positioned in 
front of the window to block the Mogadorians from entering or seeing into the room. 

"Better than nothing," Henri says. He turns to Six. "How much time do we have?" 

"Time is short," she says. "They have an outpost three hours from here, in a hollo wed-out mountain in 
West Virginia." 



Henri snaps the gun open, slides in two new cartridges, snaps it shut. 
"How many bullets does that hold?" I ask. 



"Ten," he says. 

Sarah and Mark whisper to each other. I walk over to them. 
"You guys okay?" I ask. 

Sarah nods, Mark shrugs, neither really knowing quite what to say in the terror of the situation. I kiss 
Sarah on the cheek and take hold of her hand. 

"Don't worry," I say. "We'll get out of this." 

I turn to Six and Henri. "Why are they just out there waiting?" I ask. "Why don't they break a window 
and rush in? They know they have us outnumbered." 



"They only want to keep us here, inside," Six says. "They have us exactly where they want us, all 
together, confined to one place. Now they're waiting for the others to arrive, the soldiers with the 
weapons, the ones who are skilled at killing. They're desperate now because they know we're 
developing our Legacies. They can't afford to screw it up and risk us getting stronger. They know that 
some of us can now fight back." 

"We have to get out of here then," Sarah pleads, her voice soft and shaky. 

Six nods reassuringly to her. And then I remember something I had forgotten in all the excitement. 

"Wait, your being here, us being together, that breaks the charm. All the others are fair game now," I 
say. "They can kill us at will." 

I can see by the look of horror on Henri's face that it had slipped his mind as well. 

Six nods. "I had to risk it," she says. "We can't keep running, and I'm sick of waiting. We're all 

developing, all of us are ready to hit back. Let's not for get what they did to us that day, and I'm not 

going to forget what they did to Katarina. Everybody we know is dead, our families, our friends. I think 

they're planning to do the same thing to Earth as they did to Lorien, and they are almost ready. To sit 

back and do nothing is to allow that same destruction, that same death and annihilation. Why stand 
back 

and let it happen? If this planet dies, we die with it." 

Bernie Kosar is still barking at the window. I almost want to let him outside, see what he can do. His 
mouth is frothing with his teeth bared, hair standing tall down the center of his back. The dog is ready, I 
think.The question is, are the rest of us? 



"Well, you're here now," Henri says. "Let's hope the others are safe; let's hope they can fend for 
themselves. Both of you will know immediately if they can't. As for us, war has come to our doorstep. 
We didn't ask for it, but now that it's here we have no choice but to meet it, head on, with full force," he 
says. He lifts his head and looks at us, the whites of his eyes glistening through the dark of the room. 

"I agree with you, Six," he says. "The time has come." 



CHAPTER THIRTY 



WIND FROM THE OPEN WINDOW RUSHES INTOthe home economics room, the refrigerator in 

front of it doing little to prevent the cold air. The school is already chilly from the electricity being off. Six 

is now wearing only the rubber suit, which is entirely black aside from a gray band slicing diagonally 

down the front of it. She is standing in the middle of our group with such poise and confidence that I 
wish 

I had a Loric suit of my own. She opens her mouth to speak but is interrupted by a loud boom from 
outside. All of us rush to the windows but can see nothing of what is happening. The crash is followed by 
several loud bangs, and the sounds of tearing, gnashing, something being destroyed. 



"What's happening?" I ask. 



"Your lights," Henri says over the sounds of destruction. 

I turn them on and sweep them across the yard outside. They reach but ten feet before being 
swallowed 

by the darkness. Henri steps back and tilts his head, listening to the sounds in extreme concentration, 
and 

then he nods in resigned acceptance. 

"They are destroying all the cars out there, my truck included," he says. "If we survive this and escape 
this school, it'll have to be on foot." 

Terror sweeps across both Mark's and Sarah's faces. 

"We can't waste any more time," Six says. "Strategy or no strategy, we have to go before the beasts 
and soldiers arrive. She said we can get out through the gymnasium," Six says, and nods at Sarah. "It's 
our only hope." 

"Her name is Sarah," I say. 

I sit in a nearby chair, unnerved by the urgency in Six's voice. She seems to be the steady one, the one 

who has remained calm under the weight of the terrors we have seen thus far. Bernie Kosar is back at 

the door, scratching at the fridges that are blocking it, growling and whining in impatience. Since my 
lights 

are on, Six has a good look at him for the first time. She stares at Bernie Kosar, then squints her eyes 
and inches her face forward. She walks over and bends down to pet him. I turn and look at her. I find it 
odd that she is grinning. 



"What?" I ask. 



She looks up at me. "You don't know?" 
"Know what?" 

Her grin widens. She looks back at Bernie Kosar, who races away from her and charges back to the 
window, scratching at it, growling, the occasional bark in frustration. The school is surrounded, death 
imminent, almost certain, and Six is grinning. It irritates me. 

"Your dog," she says. "You really don't know?" 

"No," says Henri. I look at him. He shakes his head at Six. 

"What the hell?" I ask. "What?" 



Six looks at me, then at Henri. She emits a half laugh and opens her mouth to speak. But just before any 
words escape something catches her eye and she rushes back to the window. We follow and, as before, 



the very subtle glow of a set of headlights sweeps around the bend in the road and into the lot of the 
school. Another car, maybe a coach or teacher. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. 

"It could mean nothing," I say. 

"Turn your lights off," Henri says to me. 

I turn them off, clench my hands into fists. Something about the car outside causes anger within me. 
The 

hell with the exhaustion, with the shakes that have been present ever since I jumped through the 

principal's window. I can't take being confined in this room any longer, knowing that the Mogadorians 

are out there, waiting, and plotting our doom. That car outside may be the first of the soldiers arriving 
on 

the scene. But just when that thought pops into my mind, we see the lights quickly retreat from the lot, 
and speed away in a hurry, down the same road they came. 

"We have to get out of this damn school," Henri says. 



Henri sits in a chair ten feet away from the door with the shotgun aimed right at it. He is breathing 
slowly 

though he is tense and I can see the muscles flexed in his jaw. None of us say a word. Six made herself 
invisible and slipped out to do some exploring. We're just waiting, and finally it comes. Three slight taps 
on the door, Six's knock so that we know it's her and not a scout trying to enter. Henri lowers the gun 
and she walks in and I return one of the fridges to block the door behind her. She was gone for a full ten 
minutes. 



"You were right," she says to Henri. "They've destroyed every car in the lot, and have somehow moved 
the wreckage to block every door from being opened. And Sarah is right; they've overlooked the stage 
hatch. I counted seven scouts outside and five inside walking the halls. There was one outside this door 
but it's been disposed of. They seem to be getting antsy. I think that means the others should have been 
here already, which means they can't be far." 

Henri stands and grabs the Chest and nods at me. I help him open it. He reaches in and pulls out a few 
small round pebbles that he sticks in his pocket. I have no idea what they are. Then he closes and locks 
the Chest and slides it into one of the ovens and closes the door. I move a refrigerator up against the 
oven to keep it from being opened. There really is no other choice. The Chest is heavy, it would be 
impossible to fight while carrying it, and we need every available hand to get out of this mess. 

"I hate to leave it behind," Henri says, shaking his head. Six nods uneasily. Something in the thought of 
the Mogadorians getting ahold of the Chest terrifies them both. 

"It'll be fine here," I say. 

Henri lifts the shotgun and pumps it once, looks at Sarah and Mark. 

"This isn't your fight," he tells them. "I don't know what to expect out there, but if this thing goes badly 
you guys get back in this school and stay hidden. They aren't after you, and I don't think they'll care to 
come looking if they already have us."

Sarah and Mark both look stricken with fear, both holding their respective knives with white -knuckled 

grips in their right hands. Mark has lined his belt with everything from the kitchen drawers that might be 
of 

useâ€”more knives, the meat tenderizer, cheese grater, a pair of scissors. 

"We go left out of this room, and when we reach the end of the hall, the gymnasium is past double 
doors 

twenty or so feet to the right," I say to Henri. 

"The hatch is in the very middle of the stage," Six says. "It's covered with a blue mat. There were no 
scouts in the gym, but that doesn't mean they won't be there this time around." 

"So we're just going to go outside and try to outrun them?" Sarah asks. Her voice is full of panic. She's 
breathing heavily. 

"It's our only choice," says Henri. 

I grab her hand. She is shaking badly. 



"It'll be okay," I say. 



"How do you know that?" she says in a more demanding tone than a questioning one. 



"I don't," I say. 

Six moves the fridge from the door. Bernie Kosar immediately starts scratching at the door, trying to get 
out, growling. 

"I can't make you all invisible," Six says. "If I disappear, I'll still be nearby." 

Six grabs hold of the doorknob and Sarah takes a deep, shaky breath beside me, squeezing my hand as 
tightly as she can. I can see the knife quivering in her right hand. 

"Stay close to me," I say. 

"I'm not leaving your side." 

The door swings open and Six jumps out into the hall, Henri close behind. I follow and Bernie Kosar 

races ahead of us all, a ball of fury speeding away. Henri points the shotgun one way, then the o ther. 
The 

hallway is empty. Bernie Kosar has already reached the intersection. He disappears. Six follows suit and 
makes herself invisible and the rest of us run towards the gym, Henri in the lead. I make Mark and Sarah 
go ahead of me. None of us can really see a thing, can only hear each other's footsteps. I turn my lights 
on to help guide the way, and that's the first mistake I make. 

A classroom door to my right swings open. Everything happens in a split second and, before I have a 



chance to react, I am hit in the shoulder with something heavy. My lights shut off. I crash straight 
through 

a glass display window. I'm cut on the top of my head and blood runs down the side of my face almost 
immediately. Sarah screams. Whatever it was that hit me clubs me again, a hollow thud in my ribs that 
knocks the wind from me. 

"Turn your lights on!" Henri yells. I do. A scout stands ov er me, holding a six-foot-long piece of wood 
that it must have found in the industrial arts classroom. It raises it in the air to hit m e again, but Henri, 
standing twenty feet away, fires the shotgun first. The scout's head disappears, blown to pieces. The rest 



of its body turns to ash before it even hits the floor. 

Henri lowers the gun. "Shit," he says, catching sight of the blood. He takes a step towards me and then 
from the corner of my eye I see another scout, in the same doorway, a sledgehammer raised over its 
head. It comes charging forward and, with telekinesis, I throw the nearest thing to me without even 
knowing what that thing is. A golden glinting object that speeds through the air with violence. It hits the 
scout so hard that its skull cracks on impact, and then it falls to the ground and lies motionless. Henri, 
Mark, and Sarah rush over. The scout is still alive and Henri takes Sarah's knife and thrusts it through its 
chest, reducing it to a pile of ash. He hands Sarah back her knife. She holds it out in front of her, 
between thumb and forefinger, as though she's just been handed a pair of somebody's dirty underwear. 



Mark bends down and lifts the object I had thrown, now in three separate pieces. 

"It's my all-conference trophy," he says, and then can't help but chuckle to himself. "It was given to me 
last month." 

I stand. It was the trophy case that I crashed through. 
"You okay?" Henri asks, looking at the cut. 
"Yeah, I'm fine. Let's keep going." 

We rush down the hall and into the gymnasium, sprint across the floor, jump up onto the stage. I flip 
my 

lights on to see the blue mat being mov ed away as though of its own volition. Then the hatch is thrown 
up. Only then does Six make herself visible again. 

"What happened back there?" she asks. 

"Ran into a little bit of trouble," Henri says, climbing down the ladder first to make sure the coast is 
clear. Then Sarah and Mark go. 

"Where is the dog?" I ask. 

Six shakes her head. 

"Go on," I say. She goes down first, leaving only me on the stage. I whistle as loudly as I can, knowing 



full well that I'm giving away my position by doing so. I wait. 
"Come on, John," Henri calls up from below. 

I crawl into the hatch, my feet on the ladder, but from the waist up I'm still on the stage, watching. 

"Come on!" I say to myself. "Where are you?" And in that split second when I have no choice but to 
give up, but just before I drop down, Bernie Kosar materializes on the far side of the gym and comes 
sprinting my way, ears pinned to the sides of his head. I smile. 

"Come on!" Henri yells this time. 

"Hold on!" I yell back. 

Bernie Kosar jumps onto the stage and into my arms. 



"Here!" I yell, and hand the dog to Six. I drop down, close and lock the hatch and turn my lights on as 
brightly as they'll go. 



The walls and floor are made of concrete, reeking of mildew. We have to walk in a low crouch to keep 

from hitting our heads. Six leads the way. The tunnel is about a hundred feet long and I have no idea 
what 

purpose this could have served at one time. We reach the end; a short flight of steps leads to a pair of 
metal cellar doors. Six waits until everyone is together. 

"Where does this open?" I ask. 

"Behind the faculty lot," Sarah says. "Not far from the football field." 

Six presses her ear to listen in the small crack between the closed doors. Nothing but the wind. 
Everyone's face is streaked with sweat, dust, and fear. Six looks at Henri and nods. I turn my lights off. 

"All right," she says, and makes herself invisible. 

She inches the door up just enough to stick her head out and have a look around. The rest of us watch 
with bated breath, waiting, listening, all of us wracked with nerves. She turns one way, then the other. 
Satisfied we've made it unnoticed, she pushes the door all the way open and we file out one by one. 

Everything is dark and silent, no wind, the forest trees to our right standing motionless. I look around, 
can see the busted silhouettes of the twisted cars piled in front of the doors of the school. No stars or 
moon. No sky at all, almost as though we're beneath a bubble of darkness, some sort of dome where 
only shadows remain. Bernie Kosar begins to growl, low at first so that my initial thought is that it's done 
for reasons of anxiety only; but the growl grows into something more ferocious, more menacing, and I 
know that he senses something out there. All of our heads turn to see what he is growling at but nothing 
moves. I take a step forward to put Sarah behind me. I think to turn on my lights but I know that will give 



us away even more so than the dog's growl. Suddenly, Bernie Kosar takes off. 



He charges ahead thirty yards before leaping through the air and sinking his teeth deeply into one of 
the 

unseen scouts, who materializes from out of nowhere as though some spell of invisibility has been 
broken. 

In an instant, we're able to see them all, surrounding us, no fewer than twenty of them, who begin 
closing 

in. 

"It was a trap!" Henri yells, and fires twice and drops two scouts immediately. 
"Get back in the tunnel!" I scream to Mark and Sarah. 

One of the scouts comes charging towards me. I lift it in the air and hurl it as hard as I can against an 
oak 

tree twenty yards away. It hits the ground with a thud, quickly stands, and hurls a dagger my way. I 

deflect it and lift the scout again and throw it even harder. It bursts into ash at the base of the tree. 
Henri 

unloads more rounds, the shots echoing. Two hands grab me from behind. I almost deflect them until I 
realize that it's Sarah. Six is nowhere to be seen. Bernie Kosar has brought a Mogadorian to the ground, 
his teeth now sunk deeply into its throat, hell ablaze in the dog's eyes. 

"Get into the school!" I yell. 

She doesn't let go. A clap of thunder breaks through the silence and a storm begins to brew, dark 
clouds now forming overhead with flashes of lighting and thunder tearing through the night sky, loud 



pounding thunder that makes Sarah jump each time one booms. Six has reappeared, standing thirty feet 



away, her eyes to the sky and her face twisted in concentration with both arms raised. She's the one 

creating the storm, controlling the weather. Bolts of lightning begin raining down, striking the scouts 
dead 

where they stand, creating small explosions that form clouds of ash that drift listlessly across the yard. 
Henri stands off to the side, loading more shells into the shotgun. The scout that Bernie Kosar is choking 
finally succumbs to death and bursts into a heap of ash covering the dog's face. He sneezes once, shakes 
the ash from his coat and then rushes off and chases the closest scout until they both disappear into the 
dense woods fifty yards away. I have this unbearable fear that I've seen him for the very last time. 

"You have to go into the school," I say to Sarah. "You have to go now and you have to hide. Mark!" I 
yell. I look up and don't see him. I snap around. I catch sight of him sprinting towards Henri, who is still 
loading his gun. At first I don't understand why, and then I see what is happening: a Mogadorian scout 
has snuck up on Henri without his knowing it. 

"Henri," I scream to get his attention. I lift my hand to stop the scout with its knife raised high in the air, 
but Mark tackles the thing first. A wrestling match ensues. Henri snaps the shotgun closed, and Mark 
kicks the scout's knife away. Henri fires and the scout explodes. Henri says something to Mark. I yell for 
Mark again and he sprints over, breathing heavily. 



"You have to take Sarah into the school." 



"I can help here," he says. 

"It's not your fight. You have to hide! Get in the school and hide with Sarah!" 
"Okay," he says. 

"You have to stay hidden, no matter what!" I yell over the storm. "They won't come for you. It's me 
they want. Promise me, Mark! Promise me you'll stay hidden with Sarah!" 

Mark nods rapidly. "I promise!" 

Sarah is crying and there's no time to comfort her. Another clap of thunder, another shotgun blast. She 
kisses me one time on the lips, her hands holding tightly to my face and I know she would stay like this 
forev er. Mark pulls her off, begins leading her away. 

"I love you," she says, and in her eyes she is staring at me in the same way that I had stared at her 
earlier, before I left home ec, as though she may be seeing me for the final time, wanting to remember it 
so that this last image might last a lifetime. 

"I love you too," I mouth back just as the two of them reach the steps of the tunnel, and as soon as the 
words leave my lips, Henri cries out in pain. I turn. One of the scouts has thrust a knife into his gut. 
Terror sweeps through me. The scout pulls the knife fr om Henri's side, the blade glistening with his 



blood. It thrusts down to stab Henri a second time. My hand reaches out for it and I rip the knife away at 

the last second so that it is only a fist that hits Henri. He grunts, gathers himself, and presses the barrel 
of 

the shotgun to the chin of the scout and fires. The scout drops, headless. 

The rain starts, a cold, heavy rain. In no time at all I'm soaked to the bone. Blood leaks from Henri's 
gut. He's aiming the shotgun into the darkness, but all of the scouts have moved into the shadows, away 
from us, so that Henri can't get a good enough aim. They're no longer interested in attacking, knowing 
that two of us have retreated and a third has been wounded. Six is still reaching for the sky. The storm 
has grown; the wind is beginning to howl. She seems to be having trouble controlling it. A winter storm, 



Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html 



thunder in January. As quickly as everything started, it all seems to stopâ€”the thunder, the lightning, the 

rain. The wind dies away and a low groan begins to grow from off in the distance. Six lowers her arms, 

all of us straining to listen. Even the Mogadorians turn. The groan grows, unmistakably coming our way, 

some sort of deep mechanical groan. The scouts step from the shadows and begin to laugh. Despite our 

killing at least ten of them, there are many more than before. From far off a cloud of smoke rises over 
the 

tops of the trees as if a steam engine is coming around the bend. The scouts nod to one another, smiling 
their wicked smiles, and re-form their circle around us in what is an apparent attempt to get us back into 
the school. And it's obvious that that is our only choice. Six walks over. 



"What is it?" I ask. 



Henri hobbles, the shotgun hanging limply at his side. He's breathing heavily, a gash on his cheek below 
his right eye, a circular puddle of blood on his gray sweater from the knife wound. 

"It's the rest of them, isn't it?" Henri asks Six. 

Six looks at him, stricken, her hair wet and clinging to the sides of her face. 
"The beasts," she says. "And the soldiers. They're here." 

Henri cocks the shotgun and takes a deep breath. "And so the real war begins," he says. "I don't know 
about you two, but if this is it, then this is it. I, for one...," he says, and trails off. "Well, I'll be damned if 
I'll go down without a fight." 

Six nods. "Our people fought back till the end. And so shall I," she says. 

A mile off the smoke still rises. Live cargo, I think.That is how they transport them, by oversized 
semi-trucks. Six and I follow Henri back down the steps. I yell for Bernie Kosar but he's nowhere to be 
seen. 

"We can't wait for him again," Henri says. "There isn't time." 

I look around one final time, and slam the cellar doors shut. We rush back through the tunnel, up onto 



the stage, across the gymnasium. We don't see a single scout, nor do we see Mark and Sarah, and I'm 

relieved by that. I hope they are well hidden, and I hope Mark keeps his promise and that they stay that 

way. When we make it back to the home-ec room I slide the fridge out of the way and grab the Chest. 

Henri and I open it. Six takes the healing stone out and thrusts it against Henri's gut. He is silent, his eyes 

closed, holding his breath. His face is red under the strain but not a single sound escapes. A minute of 
this 

and Six pulls the stone away. The cut has healed. Henri exhales, his forehead covered in sweat. Then it's 
my turn. She presses it to the gash on my head and a pain far greater than anything I've ever felt before 
rips through me. I grunt and groan, every muscle in my body flexing. I can't breathe until it's over, and 
when it finally is, I bend over and catch my breath for a full minute. 

Outside the mechanical groan has stopped. The semi is hidden from view. While Henri closes up the 
Chest and places it back in the same oven as before, I look out the window hoping to catch sight of 
Bernie Kosar. I don't see him. Another set of headlights passes by the school. As before, I can't tell if 
it's a car or truck, and it slows as it drives by the entrance, then quickly speeds away without turning in. 
Henri pushes his shirt down, picks up the shotgun. As we move towards the door, a sound stops the 
three of us dead in our tracks. 



A roar comes from outside, loud, animal-like, a sinister roar unlike anything I have ever heard before, 



followed by the sound of the metallic clicks of a gate being unlocked, lowered, and opened. A loud bang 
snaps us all back to attention. I take another deep breath. Henri shakes his head and sighs in what is an 
almost hopeless gesture, a gesture made when the fight is lost. 

"There's always hope, Henri," I say. He turns and looks at me. "New developments hav e yet to present 
themselves. Not all the information is in. Don't give up hope just yet." 

He nods and the tiniest trace of a smile forms. He looks at Six, a new development that I don't think 
either of us could have imagined. Who's to say that there aren't more waiting? And then he picks up 
where I left off, quoting the exact words he spoke to me when I was the one who was discouraged, the 
day I asked how we could possibly expect to win this fight, alone and outnumbered, far from 
homeâ€”against the Mogadorians, who seem to take great joy in war and death. "It's the last thing to go," 
Henri says. "When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all 
is dire and bleak, there is always hope." 

"Exactly," I say. 



CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE 



ANOTHER ROAR CUTS THROUGH THE NIGHT AIR.through the walls of the school, a roar that 
makes my blood turn cold. The ground begins to rumble under the footsteps of the beast that must now 
be on the loose. I shake my head. I saw firsthand how big they were during the flashbacks of the war on 



Lorien. 



"For your friends' sake and ours," Six says, "we better get the hell out of this school while there's still 
time. They'll destroy the entire building trying to get to us." 

We nod to one another. 

"Our only hope is to get to the woods," Henri says. "Whatever that thing is, we might be able to escape 
it if we can stay invisible." 

Six nods. "Just keep ahold of my hands." 

Needing no other motiv ation than that, Henri and I each take a hand. 
"As quietly as we can," Henri says. 

The hallway is dark and silent. We walk with a quiet urgency, moving as swiftly as we can while making 
little noise. Another roar, and in the middle of it, another roar begins. We stop. Not one beast, buttwo . 
We continue on and enter the gymnasium. No sign of the scouts. When we reach the very center of the 
court, Henri stops. I look over but can't see him. 

"Why are we stopped?" I whisper. 



"Shh," he says. "Listen." 



I strain to listen, but hear nothing aside from the steady hum of blood filling my ears. 



"The beasts have stopped moving," Henri says. 
"So what?" 

"Shh," he says. "There's something else out there." 

And then I hear it too, slight high-pitched yipping sounds as though coming from small animals. The 
sounds are muffled, though obviously growing louder. 

"What the hell?" I ask. 

Something begins banging at the stage hatch, the hatch we are hoping to escape through. 
"Turn your lights on," he says. 

I let go of Six's hand, snap them on, and aim them towards the stage. Henri looks down the end of the 
shotgun barrel. The hatch bounces up as though something is trying to force itself through but lacks the 



strength to do so.The weasels, I think,the stout-bodied little creatures that the guys in Athens were 
terrified of. One of them hits the hatch so hard that it breaks away from the stage and rattles across the 
floor. So much for thinking they lacked strength. Two of them come bursting forth, and upon catching 
sight of us, come racing our way so swiftly that I can hardly make them out. Henri stands watching with 
the gun aimed, an amused grin on his face. Their paths diverge and both leap from about twenty feet 
away, one jumping at Henri, the other coming at me. Henri fires once and the weasel explodes and 
covers him with its blood and guts; and just as I'm about to rip apart the second with telekinesis, it is 
snatched out of midair by Six's unseen hand and spiked to the ground like a football, killing it instantly. 

Henri cocks the shotgun. "Well, that wasn't so bad," he says, and before I can respond, the entire wall 
along the stage is smashed in by the fist of a beast. It draws back and punches again, smashing the stage 
to smithereens and exposing the night sky. The impact pushes both Henri and me backwards. 

"Run!" Henri yells, and he immediately unloads every shell in the shotgun into the beast. They have no 
effect upon it. The beast leans forward and roars so loudly that I feel my clothes flutter. A hand reaches 
out and grabs hold of me, turning me invisible. The beast charges ahead, moving straight for Henri, and 
I'm gripped with terror at what it might do. 

"No!" I scream. "To Henri, get to Henri!" I twist under Six's grip, finally grabbing hold of her and 
pushing her away. I become visible; she stays hidden. The beast surges towards Henri, who stands firm 
and watches it come. Out of bullets. Out of options. "Get to him!" I scream again. "Get to him, Six!" 

"Go to the woods!" she yells back. 

All I can do is watch. The beast must stand thirty feet tall, maybe forty, towering over Henri. It roars, 



pure wrath in its eyes. Its muscled and bulging fist rushes high in the air, so high that it breaks straight 

through the rafters and the roof of the school gymnasium. And then it falls, speeding down with such 

swiftness that it becomes a blur, like the blades of a spinning fan. I cry out in horror, knowing that Henri 

is about to be crushed. I can't look away, Henri seeming tiny standing there with the shotgun limply at 
his 

side. When the fist of the beast is a split second from him, Henri disappears. The fist crashes through the 

gymnasium floor, the wood splintering, the impact sending me crashing into the stands twenty feet 
away. 

The beast turns to me, blocking from view the place where Henri had just stood. 



"Henri!" I yell. The beast roars so that any response that might have come is drowned out. It takes one 
step towards me. To the woods, Six had said. Go to the woods. I stand and run as fast as I can to the 
back of the gym, where the beast had just broken through. I turn to see if the beast is following. It is not. 
Perhaps Six has done something to divert its attention. All I know is that I'm on my own now, alone. 

I leap over the pile of rubble and sprint away from the school, running as hard as I can for the woods. 
The shadows swarm around me, following like villainous wraiths. I know that I can outrun them. The 
beast roars and I hear another wall crumble. I reach the trees and the swarming shadows seem to have 
disappeared. I stop and listen. The trees sway under a light breeze. There is a wind here! I've escaped 
whatever dome the Mogadorians have created. Something warm collects at the waistband of my pants. 



The cut I suffered at Mark James's has reopened on m y back. 



The school's silhouette is faint from where I stand. The entire gymnasium is gone, a pile of brick. The 
beast's shadow stands tall in the rubble of the cafeteria. Why hasn't it run after me? And where is the 
second beast we all heard? The beast's fist falls again, another room demolished. Mark and Sarah are 
there somewhere. I told them to go back and I realize how foolish it was. I didn't anticipate the beast 
destroying the school if it knew I wasn't there. I have to do something to get the beast away. I take a 
deep breath to gather my strength, and as soon as I take that first step, something hard hits me in the 
back of the head. I fall face-first into the mud. I touch where I've been hit and my hand is covered in 
blood, drips of it falling from my fingertips. I turn around and see nothing at first, and then it steps out of 
the shadows and grins. 

A soldier. This is what they look like. Taller than the scoutsâ€” sev en, maybe eight feet tallâ€”its muscles 
bulging beneath a black ragged cloak. Large, raised veins traverse the length of each arm. Black boots. 
Nothing covering its head, and its hair falling to its shoulders. The same pale, waxy skin as the scouts. A 
grin of self-assurance, of finality. In one of its hands is a sword. Long and shimmering, made of some 
kind of metal I've never seen here on Earth or in my visions of Lorien, and it appears to be pulsing, as if it 
is somehow alive. 

I begin to crawl away, the blood dripping down my neck. The beast at the school lets out another roar, 

and I reach for the low branches of a nearby tree and pull myself up. The soldier is ten feet away. I grip 

both hands into fists. It motions the sword nonchalantly towards me, and something comes out of its 
tip, 

something that looks like a small dagger. I watch the dagger twist in an arc, leaving a slight trail behind it 
like smoke from a plane. The light casts a spell that I can't look away from. 



A flash of bright light devours everything, the world dimming away into a soundless void. No walls. No 
sound. No floor or ceiling. Very slowly the shapes of things return, the trees standing like ancient effigies 
whispering of the world that once was in some alternate realm where only shadows reside. 

I reach out to feel the nearest tree, the only touch of gray in an otherwise white world. My hand goes 

through it and for a moment the tree shimmers as if it were liquid. I take a deep breath. When I exhale 
the 

pain returns to the gash on the back of my head and the tears down my arms and body from the James 

house fire. A sound of dripping water comes from somewhere. Slowly, the soldier takes form, twenty or 

thirty feet away. Giantlike. We take each other in. Its sword glowing more brightly in this new world. Its 

eyes narrow and my hands again clench into fists. I've lifted objects far heavier than it; I've split trees 
and 

I've caused destruction. Surely I can match its strength with my own. I push everything that I feel into 
the 

core of my being, everything that I am and everything that I will be, until I feels as though I'm about to 
burst. 

"Yahhhh!" I yell, and I thrust my arms forward. The brute force leaves my body, raging towards the 
soldier. At the same time it sweeps the sword across its body as though swatting a fly. The power

deflects into the trees, which dance for a brief moment like the grain in a wheat field waving in a light 



wind, and then they become still. It laughs at me, a deep, guttural laugh meant to taunt. Its red eyes 
begin 

to glow, swirling as though lava filled. It lifts its free hand and I tense myself against the unknown. And 

without my knowing what has happened, my throat is in its grip, the gap that had separated us closed in 

the blink of an eye. It lifts me, one handed, breathing with its mouth open so that I can smell the sour 

stench of its breath, the smell of decay. I thrash, try to pry its fingers from around my throat, but they 
are 

like iron. 

And then it throws me. 

I land on my back forty feet away. I stand and it charges, swinging the sword at my head, which I duck 
and counter by pushing it as hard as I can. It stumbles back but stays standing. I try to lift it with 
telekinesis but nothing happens. In this alternate world my powers are dimmed, almost ineffectual. The 
Mogadorian has the advantage here. 

It smiles at my futility and raises the sword with both hands. The sword comes alive, turning from 

shimmering silver into ice blue. Blue flames lick across the blade. A sword that glows with power, just as 

Six had talked about. It swings the sword in my direction and another dagger comes flying off the tip, 

straight at me. This I can do, I think. All the hours in the backyard with Henri preparing for this very thing. 

Always the knives, more or less the same as a dagger. Did Henri know they would use them? Certainly, 

though in my flashbacks of the invasion I had never seen them. But I had never seen these creatures, 

either. They were different on Lorien, not quite as sinister looking. On the day of the invasion they 
looked 

sickly and starved. Is it Earth's fault for this convalescence, have the resources here caused them to 
grow 

stronger and healthier? 



The dagger literally screams as it rages towards me. It grows and becomes consumed in flames. Just 

when I am about to deflect it, it explodes into a ball of fire, and the flames jump to me. I'm trapped 
within 

it, consumed in a perfect sphere of fire. Anyone else would burn, but not me, and somehow it causes my 

strength to return. I'm able to breathe. Without the soldier knowing it, it has made me stronger. Now 
it's 

my turn to smile at its own futility. 
"Is this all you've got?" I yell. 

Its face turns into rage. It defiantly reaches one hand over its shoulder and returns with a cannonlike 
gun 

that begins conforming to its body, the gun wrapping around its forearm. Its arm and the gun becoming 

one and the same. I pull the knife from my back pocket, the knife that I grabbed from home before 

returning to school. Small, ineffectual, but better than nothing. I open the blade and charge. The ball of 

fire charges with me. The soldier squares its body and brings down its sword with force. I deflect it with 

the pocketknife but the weight of the sword snaps the blade in two. I drop the remaining pieces and 

swing as hard as I can. My fist slams into the soldier's gut. It doubles over but comes right back up and 

swings the sword again. I duck beneath the blade at the last second. It singes the hair on top of my head. 

Right behind the sword comes the cannon. No time to react. It hits me in my shoulder and I grunt and 
fall 

backwards. The soldier regroups and points the cannon in the air. I'm confounded at first. The gray from 
the trees is being pulled away and sucked into the gun. Then I understand. The gun. It needs to be 
charged before it can be fired, needs to steal Earth's essence in order to be used. The gray in the trees 
isn't shadows; the gray is the life of the trees at its most elemental level. And now those lives are being 



stolen, consumed by the Mogadorians. A race of aliens that depleted their planet's resources in the 
quest 

for advancement, now doing the same thing here. That is the reason they attacked Lorien. The same 
reason they will attack Earth. One by one the trees fall and crumble into heaps of ash. The gun glows 
brighter and brighter, so bright that it hurts the eyes to look at. No time to spare. 



I charge. It keeps the gun pointed at the sky and swings the sword. I duck and plow straight into it. Its 
body tenses and it writhes in agony. The fire surrounding me burns it where it stands. But I've left myself 
open. It swings the blade feebly, not enough to cut me, but there is nothing I can do to prevent its fall. It 
hits me and my body is hurled backwards fifty feet as though I've been struck by a bolt of lightning. I lie 
there, my body shaking with postelectrocution tremors. I lift my head. Thirty piles of ash from the fallen 
trees surround us. How many times will that allow him to fire? A slight wind kicks up and the ash begins 
filtering across the empty space between us. The moon returns. This world to which it has brought me is 
beginning to fail. It knows it. The gun is ready. I wrestle myself up from the ground. Sitting a couple feet 
away, still glowing, is one of the daggers it fired at me. I pick it up. 

It lowers the cannon and aims. The white surrounding us is beginning to dim, color returning. And then 
the cannon fires, a bright flash of light containing the ghoulish forms of everyone I have ever 
knownâ€”Henri, Sam, Bernie Kosar, Sarahâ€”all of them dead in this alternate realm and the light so bright 
that they are all I can see, trying to take me with them, raging forward in a ball of energy growing as it 



nears. I try to deflect the blast but it's too strong. The white makes it as far as the fiery enclosure, and 

when the two touch an explosion erupts and the power sends me backwards. I land with a thud. I take 

inventory. I am unharmed. The ball of fire has extinguished. Somehow it has absorbed the blast, has 

saved me from what I am certain would have been death. Surely that is how the cannon works, the 
death 

of one thing for the death of another. The power of mind control, manipulation that plays on fear, 
possible 

through the destruction of the elements of the world. The scouts have learned to do this weakly with 
their 

minds. The soldiers rely on weapons that produce a m uch greater effect. 

I stand, the glowing knife still in my hand. The soldier pulls some sort of lever on the side of the cannon 
as though to reload it. I sprint towards it. When I'm close enough, I aim for its heart and hurl the knife as 
hard as I can. It fires a second shot. A torpedo of orange raging its way, the certainty of a white death 
coming mine. They cross in midair without touching. Just when I expect that second shot to hit, to bring 
upon that death, something else happens instead. 

My knife strikes first. 

The world vanishes. The shadows fade and the cold and the dark return as though they had never left. A 

vertiginous transition. I take a step backwards and fall. My eyes adjust to the dearth of light. I fix them 
on 

the dark figure of the soldier hovering over me. The cannon blast didn't travel with us. The glowing knife 

did, the blade sunk deeply into its heart, the handle pulsating orange beneath the moonlight overhead. 
The 

soldier staggers, and then the knife is sucked in deeper and disappears. It grunts. Spurts of black blood 
pump from the open wound. Its eyes go blank, then roll back into its head. It falls to the ground, lies 



motionless, and then explodes into a cloud of ash that covers my shoes. A soldier. I've killed my first. 
May it not be the last. 

Something about being in the alternate realm has weakened me. I place my hand on a nearby tree to 
steady myself and catch my breath, only the tree is no longer there. I look around. All the trees 
surrounding us have collapsed into heaps of ash just as they did in the other realm, just as the 
Mogadorians do when they die. 

I hear the roar of the beast and I look up to see how much of the school is left standing. But instead of 
the school there is something else, fifteen feet away, standing tall with a sword in one hand and a 

similar-looking cannon in the other. The cannon is aimed right at my heart, a cannon that has already 
been 

charged, glowing with power. Another soldier. I don't think I have the strength to fight this one as I did 
the last. 

There is nothing I can throw, and the gap between us is too great to charge before it fires. And then its 



arm twitches and the sound of a gunshot rings through the air. My body instinctively jerks, expecting the 
cannon to rip me in half. But I am fine, unharmed. I look up confused, and there, in the soldier's 
forehead, is a hole the size of a quarter spurting its hideous blood. Then it drops and disintegrates. 



"That's for my dad," I hear behind me. I turn. Sam, holding a silver pistol in his right hand. I smile at him. 
He lowers the gun. "They passed right through the center of town," he says. "I knew it was them as soon 
as I saw the trailer." 

I try to catch my breath, staring in awe at Sam's figure. Just moments before, in the first soldier's blast, 
he was a decaying corpse sprung from hell to take me away. And now he just saved me. 

"You okay?" he asks. 

I nod. "Where did you just come from?" 

"I followed them in my dad's truck after they passed my house. I pulled in fifteen minutes ago and got 
swarmed by the ones that were already here. So I left and parked in a field a mile away and walked 
through the woods." 

The second set of lights we had seen from the window of the school came from Sam's truck. I open my 

mouth to respond but a clap of thunder shakes the sky. Another storm begins to brew, and relief 
courses 

through me that Six is still alive. A bolt of lightning cuts the sky and clouds begin rushing in from all 

directions, being pulled together into one giant mass. An even greater darkness falls, followed by a rain 

so heavy that I have to squint to see Sam five feet away from me. The school is blotted out. But then a 

great bolt of lightning strikes and everything brightens for a split second, and I see that the beast has 
been 

hit. An agonizing roar follows. 



"I have to get to the school!" I yell. "Mark and Sarah are somewhere inside." 
"If you're going, then I'm going," he yells back over the rumble of the storm. 

We take no more than five steps before the wind comes howling, pushing us back, torrential rain 
stinging 

our faces. We're soaked, shivering and cold. But if I'm shivering then I know I'm alive. Sam drops to a 
knee, then lies on his stomach to keep from being blown backwards. I do the same. Through squinted 
eyes I look into the cloudsâ€”heavy, dark, ominousâ€”swirling in small concentric circles and, in the center, 
the center I'm trying mightily to reach, a face begins to form. 

It's an old, weathered face, bearded, tranquil looking as though it sleeps. A face that looks older than 
Earth itself. The clouds begin to lower, slowly nearing the surface and consuming everything, everything 
darkening, a dark so deep and impenetrable that it's hard to imagine that somewhere, anywhere, a sun 
still exists. Another roar, a roar of anger and doom. I try to stand but am quickly knocked back down, 

the wind too great. The face. It's coming alive. An awakening. The eyes opening, the face upturned into 

a 

grimace. Is this Six's creation? The face becomes the look of rage itself, a look of revenge. Coming 

down fast. Everything seems to hang in the balance. And then the mouth opens, hungry, its lips curling 
to 

show teeth and its eyes squinted in what can only be described as pure malice. A complete and utter 
wrath. 

And then the face touches down and a sonic blast shakes the ground, an explosion reaching out over 
the 

school, everything illuminated in red, orange, and yellow. I'm thrust backwards. Trees break in half. The 



ground rumbles. I land with a thud, branches and mud falling atop me. My ears ring as they've never 
rung 

before. A boom so loud that it must have been heard fifty miles away. And then the rain stops, and 



everything falls silent. 

I lie in the mud, listening to the beat of my heart. The clouds clear away, revealing a hanging moon. Not 
a single gust of wind. I look around but don't see Sam. I yell for him but get no response. I yearn to hear 
something, anything, another roar, Henri's shotgun, but there is nothing. 

I pull myself up off the forest floor, wipe away the mud and the twigs as best as I can. I exit the woods 
for the second time. The stars have reappeared, a million of them twinkling high in the night sky. Is it 
over? Have we won? Or is it just a lull in the action? The school, I think. I have to get to the school. I 
take one step forward, and that's when I hear it. 

Another roar, coming from within the woods behind me. 

Sound returns. Three successive gunshots ring through the night, echoing so that I have no idea from 
which direction they have come. I hope with everything inside of me that they are from Henri's shotgun, 
that he is still alive, still fighting. 



The ground begins to shake. The beast is on the run, coming for me, no mistaking it now, trees broken 

and uprooted behind me. They don't seem to slow it down at all. Is this one even bigger than the other? 
I 

don't care to find out. I take off running for the school, but then realize that's the absolute worst place I 
can go. Sarah and Mark are still there, still hiding. Or at least I hope they are. 

Everything returns to the way it was before the storm, the shadows following, looming. Scouts. Soldiers. 

I veer to the right and sprint along the tree-lined path that leads to the football field, the beast hot on 
my 

trail. Can I really expect to outrun it? If I can make it to the woods beyond the field, maybe I can. I know 
those woods, the woods that lead to our house. Within them I'll have the home-field advantage. I look 
around and see the figures of the Mogadorians in the schoolyard. There are too many of them. We're 
greatly outnumbered. Did we ever really believe we could win? 

A dagger flies by me, a flash of red missing my face by mere inches. It sticks into the trunk of a tree 
beside me and the tree ignites in flame. Another roar. The beast is keeping pace. Which of us has the 
greater endurance? I enter the stadium, sprint straight across the fifty-yard line and pass through the 
visiting team's side. Another knife whizzes by, a blue one this time. The woods are near, and when I 
finally sprint into them a smile forms on my face. I've led it away from the others. If everyone else is safe 
then I've done my job. Just when a sense of triumph blooms within me, the third dagger strikes. 

I cry out, fall face-first into the mud. I can feel the dagger between my shoulder blades. A pain so sharp 

that it paralyzes me. I try to reach to pull it free but it is up too high. It feels as though it's moving, 
digging 

itself deeper, the pain spreading as if I've been poisoned. On my stomach, in agony. I can't pull it free 
with telekinesis, my powers somehow failing me. I begin dragging myself forward. One of the 



soldiersâ€”or maybe it's a scout; I can't tell whichâ€”places a foot on my back, reaches down, and pulls 

the knife free. I grunt. The knife is gone but the pain stays. It takes its foot off of me but I can still feel its 

presence, and I wrestle myself onto my back to face it. 



Another soldier, standing tall and smiling with hatred. The same look as the one before, the same type 
of 

sword. The dagger that was in my back twists in its grip. That is what I felt, the blade turning while 

imbedded in my flesh. I lift a hand towards the soldier to move it but I know it's in vain. I can't focus, 

everything blurry. The soldier raises its sword in the air. The blade tastes death, starts glowing in the 
night 

sky behind it.I'm gone, I think.Nothing I can do. I look into its eyes. Ten years on the run and this is how 

easily it ends, how quietly. But behind it lurks something else. Something far more menacing than a 
million 

soldiers with a million swords. Teeth every bit as long as the soldier is tall, teeth glowing white in a 
mouth 



Generated by ABC Amber LIT Conv erter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.htm 1 



too small to hold them. The beast with its evil eyes hovering over us. 

A sharp intake of breath catches in my throat, and my eyes open wide in terror. It'll take us both out, I 
think. The soldier is oblivious. It tenses and grimaces at me and starts to bring the sword down to split 
me in two. But it is too slow and the beast strikes first, its jaws clamping down like a bear trap. The bite 



doesn't stop until the beast's teeth come together, the soldier's body cut cleanly in half just below the 
hips, leaving nothing behind but two stumps still standing. The beast chews twice and swallows. The 
soldier's legs fall hollowly to the ground, one dropping to the right, the other to the left, and quickly 
disintegrate. 

It takes every ounce of strength I have to reach out and grab the dagger that has fallen at my feet. I tuck 
it into the waistband of my jeans, and begin crawling away. I feel the beast hovering over me, feel its 
breath upon the nape of my neck. The smell of death and rotting meat. I enter a small clearing. I expect 
the beast's wrath to fall any second, expect its teeth and claws to rip me to shreds. I pull myself forward 
until I can go no more, my back against an oak tree. 

The beast stands in the very center of the clearing, thirty feet away from me. I look at it fully for the first 
time. A looming figure, hazy in the dark and the cold of the night. Taller and bigger than the beast at the 
school, forty feet, standing upright on two hind legs. Thick, gray skin stretched tightly over slabs of 
bulging muscle. No neck, its head sloped so that its lower jaw protrudes farther out than its upper. A set 
of fangs points towards the sky, another set points to the ground, dripping blood and drool. Long, thick 
arms hang a foot or two above the ground even while the beast stands straight, giving it the appearance 
of slightly leaning forward. Yellow eyes. Round disks at the sides of its head that pulsate with the beating 
of its heart, the only sign that it has any sort of heart at all. 

It leans forward and brings its left hand to the ground. A hand, complete with stubby short fingers with 
claws like a raptor, claws meant to rip apart anything they touch. It sniffs at me, and roars. An 
ear-splitting roar that would have pushed me backwards if I weren't already against a tree. Its mouth 
opens, showing what must be fifty other teeth, each one every bit as sharp as the next. Its free hand 
thrusts away from its side and splits in half every tree that it strikes, ten, fifteen of them. 



No more running. No more fighting. Blood from the knife wound runs down my back; my hands and 
legs are both shaking. The dagger is still tucked into the waistband of my jeans, but what's the point in 

grabbing it? What faith is there in a four-inch blade against a forty-foot beast? It would be the 
equivalent 

of a splinter. It'll only make it angrier. My only hope is to bleed to death before I am killed and eaten. 

I close my eyes and accept death. My lights are off. I don't want to see what is about to happen. I hear 
movement behind me. I open my eyes. One of the Mogadorians must be moving in for a closer look, I 
think at first, but I know immediately that I am wrong. There is something familiar about the loping gait, 
something I recognize in the sound of his breathing. And then he enters the clearing. 

Bernie Kosar. 

I smile, but the smile quickly fades. If I am doomed, there is no point in him dying too. No, Bernie Kosar. 
You can't be here. You need to leave and you need to run like the wind, get as far away as you can. 
Pretend you've just finished our early-morning jog to school and that it's time to return home. 

He looks at me as he walks up. I am here, he seems to say.I am here and I will stand with you. 



"No," I say aloud. 



He stops long enough to give my hand a reassuring lick. He looks up at me with his big, brown eyes. Get 
away, John, I hear in my mind.Crawl if you have to crawl, but get away now. The blood loss has made 
me delusional. Bernie seems to be communicating with me. Is Bernie Kosar ev en here, or am I imagining 
that as well? 

He stands in front of me as though in protection. He begins to growl, low at first, but it grows to a growl 
every bit as ferocious as the beast's own roar. The beast fixates on Bernie Kosar. A staredown. Bernie 
Kosar's hair is raised down the center of his back, his tan ears pinned to his head. His loyalty, his 
bravery very nearly make me weep. He's a hundred times smaller than the beast yet he stands tall, 
vowing to fight. One quick strike from the beast and all is done. 

I reach my hand out to Bernie Kosar. I wish I could stand and grab him and get away. His growls are so 
fierce that his whole body shakes, tremors coursing through him. 

And then something begins to happen. 

Bernie Kosar begins to grow. 



CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO 



AFTER ALL THIS TIME, ONLY NOW DO I UNDERSTAND. The morning runs when I would run 

too fast for him to keep pace. He would disappear into the woods, reappear seconds later in front of 
me. 

Six tried to tell me. Six took one look at him and she knew immediately. On those runs Bernie Kosar 
went into the woods to change himself, to turn himself into a bird. The way he would rush outside each 
morning, nose to the ground, patrolling the yard. Protecting me, and Henri. Looking for signs of the 
Mogadorians. The gecko in Florida. The gecko that used to watch from the wall while I ate breakfast. 

How long has he been with us? The Chim ra, the ones I watched being loaded into the rocketâ€”did they 

make it to Earth after all? 

Bernie Kosar continues to grow. He tells me to run. I can communicate with him. No, that's not all. I 

can communicate with all animals. Another Legacy. It started with the deer in Florida on the day that we 

left. The shudder that ran up my spine as it passed something along to me, some feeling. I attributed it 
to 

the sadness of our leaving, but I was wrong. Mark James's dogs. The cows I passed on my morning 
runs. The same thing. I feel like such a fool to discover it only now. So blatantly obvious, right in front of 
my face. Another of Henri's adages: Those things that are most obvious are the very things we're most 
likely to overlook. But Henri knew. That is why he said no to Six when she tried to tell me. 

Bernie Kosar is done growing; his hair has fallen away, replaced by oblong scales. He looks like a 
dragon, but without the wings. His body is thick with muscle. Jagged teeth and claws, horns that curl like 
a ram's. Thicker than the beast, but far shorter. Looking every bit as menacing. Two giants on opposite 
sides of the clearing, roaring at one another. 

Run,he tells me. I try to tell him that I can't. I don't know if he can understand me. You can, he says.You 
must. 



The beast swings. A hammer swing that starts in the clouds and pours down with brutality. Bernie Kosar 

blocks it with his horns and then charges before the beast can swing again. A colossal collision in the 
very 

center of the clearing. Bernie Kosar thrusts up, sinks his teeth into the beast's side. The beast knocks him

back. 

Both of them so quick that it defies all logic. Bleeding gashes already down the sides of each. I watch 

with my back against the tree. I try to help. But my telekinesis is still failing me. Blood still pours down 
my 

back. My limbs feel heavy, as though my blood has turned to lead. I can feel myself fading. 

The beast is still upright on two legs while Bernie Kosar must fight on four. The beast makes a charge. 

Bernie Kosar lowers his head and they smash into one another, crashing through the trees off to my 
right 

side. Somehow the beast ends up on top. It sinks its teeth deep in Bernie Kosar's throat. It thrashes, 
trying to tear his throat out. Bernie Kosar twists under the beast's bite but he can't shake free. He tears 
at the beast's hide with his paws but the beast doesn't let go. 

Then a hand reaches out behind me, grabs my arm. I try to push it away but I'm incapable of doing even 



that. Bernie Kosar's eyes are closed tightly. He is straining under the beast's jaws, his throat constricted, 
unable to breathe. 

"No!" I yell. 

"Come on!" the voice yells behind me. "We need to get out of here." 
"The dog," I say, not comprehending whose v oice it is. "The dog!" 

Bernie Kosar is being bitten and choked, about to die, and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. I 
won't be far behind. I would sacrifice my own life for his. I scream out. Bernie Kosar twists his head 
around and looks at me, his face scrunched tightly in pain and agony and the oncoming death he must 
feel. 

"We have to go!" the voice behind me yells, the hand pulling me up from off the forest floor. 

Bernie Kosar's eyes stay fixed on mine. Go, he says to me. Get out of here, now, while you can. There 
isn't much time. 

I somehow reach my feet. Dizzy, the world cast in a haze around me. Only Bernie Kosar's eyes remain 
clear. Eyes that scream "Help!" even while his thoughts say otherwise. 

"We have to go!" the voice yells again. I don't turn to face it, but I know whose it is. Mark James, no 
longer hiding in the school, trying to save me from this clash. His being here must mean that Sarah is 
okay, and for a brief moment I allow myself to be relieved, but then that relief vanishes as quickly as it 



came. In this exact moment only one thing matters. Bernie Kosar, on his side, looking at me with glassy 
eyes. He saved me. It's my turn to save him. 

Mark reaches his hand across my chest, begins pulling me backwards, out of the clearing, away from 
the 

fight. I twist myself free. Bernie Kosar's eyes slowly begin to close. He's fading, I think.I won't watch 
you die, I tell him.I'm willing to watch many things in this world but I'll be damned if I'll watch you die. 
There's no response. The beast's bite hardens. It can sense that death is near. 

I take one wobbly step and pull the dagger from the waistband of my jeans. I close my fingers tightly 
around it and it comes alive and starts glowing. I'll never be able to hit the beast by throwing the dagger, 
and my Legacies have all but vanished. An easy decision. No choice but to charge. 

One deep, shaky breath. I rock my body backwards, everything tensing through the ache of exhaustion,

not an inch anywhere on me that doesn't feel some sort of pain. 



"No!" Mark yells behind me. 



I lunge forward and sprint for the beast. The beast's eyes are closed, jaws clamped tightly around 



Bernie Kosar's throat so that the moonlight glows in the pools of blood around it. Thirty feet away. Then 

twenty. The beast's eyes snap open at the exact moment I jump. Yellow eyes that twist in rage the 

second they focus upon me, sailing through the air towards them, dagger in both hands held high over 
my 

head as though in some heroic dream I never want to wake from. The beast lets go of Bernie Kosar's 
throat and moves to bite, but surely it knows that it has sensed me too late. The blade of the dagger 
glows in anticipation, and I jam it deeply into the eye of the beast. A liquid ooze immediately bursts out. 
The beast lets out a blood-curdling scream so loud that it's hard to imagine the dead being able to sleep 
through it. 

I fall flat on my back. I lift my head and watch the beast totter over me. It tries in vain to pull the dagger 
from its eye, but its hands are too big and the dagger is too small. The Mogadorian weapons function in 
some way that I don't think I'll ever understand, because of the mystical gateways between the realms. 
The dagger is no different, the black of the night rushing into the eye of the beast in a vortexlike funnel 
cloud, a tornado of death. 

The beast falls silent as the last of the great black cloud enters its skull, and the dagger is sucked in with 

it. The beast's arms fall limply to its sides. Its hands begin to shake. A violent shake that reverberates 

throughout the entirety of its massive body. When the convulsions end the beast hunches over and then 

falls to the ground with its back against the trees. Sitting, but yet still towering some twenty-fiv e feet 
over 

me. Everything silent, hanging in anticipation of what is to come. A gun fires once, very close so that my 
ears ring for seconds afterward. The beast takes a great breath and holds it in as though in meditation, 
and suddenly its head explodes, raining down pieces of brain and flesh and skull over everything, all of 
which quickly turn to ash and dust. 



The woods fall silent. I turn my head and look at Bernie Kosar, who still lies motionless on his side, his 
eyes closed. I can't tell if he's alive or not. As I look at him, he begins to change again, shrinking down to 
his normal size, while remaining lifeless. I hear the sound of crunching leaves and snapping twigs nearby. 

It takes all the strength I have just to lift my head an inch off the ground. I open my eyes and peer up 
into 

the haze of night, expecting to see Mark James. But it's not him standing over me. My breath catches in 

my throat. A looming figure, indistinct with the moon's light hovering just over it. Then he takes one 
step 

forward, blotting out the moon, and my eyes widen in anticipation and dread. 



CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE 

THE HAZY IMAGE SHARPENS. THROUGH THEexhaustion and pain and fear, a smile comes to 

my face, coupled with a sense of relief. Henri. He throws the shotgun into the bushes and drops to one 

knee beside me. He face is bloodied, his shirt and jeans in tatters, cuts down the length of both arms 
and 

on his neck, and beyond that I see that his eyes are fear-stricken from what he sees in mine. 
"Is it over?" I ask. 



"Shhh," he says. "Tell me, have you been stabbed by one of their daggers?" 



Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html 



"My back," I say. 

He closes his eyes and shakes his head. He reaches into his pocket and removes one of the small round 
stones I watched him grab from the Loric Chest before we left the home-ec room. His hands are 
shaking. 

"Open your mouth," he says. He inserts one of the stones. "Keep it under your tongue. Don't swallow 

it." He hefts me up with his hands beneath my armpits. I get to my feet and he keeps an arm on me 
while 

I regain balance. He turns me around to look at the gash on my back. My face feels warm. A sort of 

rejuvenation blooms through me from the stone. My limbs still ache with exhaustion, but enough 
strength 

has returned so that I'm able to function. 
"What is this?" 

"Loric salt. It'll slow and numb the dagger's effects," he says. "You'll feel a burst of energy, but it won't 
last long and we have to get back to the school as quickly as we can." 

The pebble is cold in my mouth, tastes nothing like saltâ€”tastes like nothing at all, actually. I look down 
and take inventory, and then brush off with my hands the ashen residue left from the fallen beast. 



"Is everyone okay?" I ask. 



"Six has been badly hurt," he says. "Sam is carrying her back to the truck as we speak; then he is going 
to drive to the school to pick us up. That's why we have to get back there." 

"Have you seen Sarah?" 

"No." 

"Mark James was just here," I say, and look at him. "I thought you were him." 
"I didn't see him." 

I look past Henri at the dog. "Bernie Kosar," I say. He is still shrinking, the scales fading away â€”tan, 
black, and brown hair taking their placeâ€”returning to the form in which I have known him most recently: 
floppy ears, short legs, long body. A beagle with a cold wet nose always ready to run. "He just saved my 
life. You knew, didn't you?" 

"Of course I knew." 

"Why didn't you tell me?" 

"Because he watched over you when I couldn't." 



"But how is he here?" 



"He was on the ship with us." 

And then I remember what I thought was a stuffed animal that used to play with me. It was really Bernie 
Kosar I was playing with, though back then his name was Hadley. 



We walk to the dog together. I crouch down and run my hand along Bernie Kosar's side. 
"We have to hurry," Henri says again. 

Bernie Kosar isn't moving. The woods are alive, swarming with shadows that can only mean one thing, 

but I don't care. I move my head to the dog's rib cage. Ever so faintly I hear theth-tump of his beating 

heart. Some glimmer of life is still left. He is covered in deep cuts and gashes, and blood seems to seep 

from everywhere. His front leg is twisted at an unnatural angle, broken. But he is still alive. I lift him as 

gently as I can, cradling him like a child in my arms. Henri helps me up, then reaches into his pocket, 

grabs another salt pebble, and plops it into his own mouth. It makes me wonder if he was talking about 

himself when he said there was little time. Both of us are unsteady. And then something catches my eye 
in 

Henri's thigh. A wound glowing navy blue through the gathering blood around it. He's also been stabbed 



by a soldier's knife. I wonder if the salt pebble is the only reason he's now standing, as it is for me. 
"What about the shotgun?" I ask. 
"I'm out of ammo." 

We walk out of the clearing, taking our time. Bernie Kosar doesn't move in my arms but I can feel that 
life hasn't left him. Not yet. We exit the woods, leaving behind us the overhanging branches and bushes 
and the smell of wet and rotting leav es. 

"Do you think you can run?" Henri asks. 

"No," I say. "But I'll run anyway." 

Up ahead of us we hear a great commotion, several grunts followed by clanking of chains. 

And then we hear a roar, not quite as sinister as the others, but loud enough so that we know it can only 
mean one thing: another beast. 

"You're kidding me," Henri says. 

Twigs snap behind us, coming from the woods. Henri and I both twist around, but the woods are too 
dense to see. I snap the light on in my left hand and sweep it through the trees to see. There must be 
seven or eight soldiers standing at the entrance of the woods, and when my light hits them they all draw 
their swords, which come alive, glowing their various colors the second they do. 



"No!" Henri yells. "Don't use your Legacies; it'll weaken you." 

But it's too late. I snap the light off. Vertigo and weakness return, then the pain. I hold my breath and 

wait for the soldiers to come charging at us. But they don't. There follows no sound aside from the 

obvious struggle happening straight ahead of us. Then an uproar of yells behind us. I turn to look. The 

glowing swords begin swaggering forward from forty feet away. A confident laugh comes from one of 
the 

soldiers. Nine of them armed and full of strength versus three of us broken and battered and armed 
with 

nothing more than our valor. The beast one way, the soldiers the other. That is the choice that we now 
face. 

Henri seems unfazed. He removes two more pebbles from his pocket and hands one to me. 



"The last two," he says, his voice shaky as though it requires a great effort just to speak. 

I plop the new pebble into my mouth and bury it beneath my tongue despite a small bit of the first still 
remaining. Renewed strength rushes through me. 



"What do you think?" he asks me. 

We are surrounded. Henri and Bernie Kosar and I are the only three left. Six badly hurt and carried 
away by Sam. Mark just here but now nowhere to be found. And that leaves Sarah, who I pray is 
tucked away safely in the school that lies a tenth of a mile ahead of us. I take a deep breath and I accept 
the inevitable. 

"I don't think it matters, Henri," I say, and look at him. "But the school is ahead of us, and that is where 
Sam will be shortly." 

What he does next catches me off guard: he smiles. He reaches his hand out and gives my shoulder a 
squeeze. His eyes are tired and red but in them I see relief, a sense of serenity as though he knows it's all 
about to end. 

"We'v e done all we could. And what's done is done. But I'm damn proud of you," he says. "You did 
amazing today. I always knew you would. There was never a doubt in my mind." 

I drop my head. I don't want him to see me cry. I squeeze the dog. For the first time since I grabbed 
him he shows a slight sign of life, lifting his head just enough so that he can lick the side of my face. He 
passes one word to me and one word only, as if that is all his strength will allow. Courage , he says. 

I lift my head. Henri steps forward and hugs me. I close my eyes and bury my face in his neck. He is still 

shaking, his body frail and weak beneath my grip. I'm sure mine is no stronger. So this is it, I think. With 

our heads held high we will walk across the field to whatever awaits there. At least there is dignity in 
that. 



"You did damn good," he says. 



I open my eyes. From over his shoulder I see the soldiers are near, twenty feet away now. They have 

stopped walking. One of them is holding a dagger that pulsates silver and gray. The soldier tosses it in 
the 

air, catches it, and hurls it at Henri's back. I lift my hand and deflect it away and it misses by a foot. My 
strength leaves me almost immediately even though the pebble is only half dissolved. 

Henri takes my free arm and drapes it over his shoulders and places his right arm around my waist. We 
stagger forward. The beast comes into view, looming just ahead in the center of the football field. The 
Mogadorians follow behind us. Perhaps they are curious to see the beast in action, to see the beast kill. 
Each step I take becomes more of an effort than the one that preceded it. My heart thuds in my chest. 
Death is forthcoming and of that I am terrified. But Henri is here. And so is Bernie Kosar. I'm happy not 
to have to face it alone. Several soldiers stand on the other side of the beast. Ev en if we could get past 
the beast, we would then have to walk straight into the soldiers, who stand with drawn swords. 

We have no choice. We reach the field and I expect the beast to pounce at any moment. But nothing 

happens. When we are within fifteen feet of it we stop. We stand leaning against each other for 
support. 

The beast is half the size of the other but still big enough to kill us all with no great effort of its own. 
Pale, 

almost translucent skin stretched over protruding ribs and knobby joints. Various pinkish scars down its 
arms and sides. White, sightless eyes. It shifts it weight and lowers itself, then swings its head low ov er 



the grass to smell what its eyes fail to see. It can sense us in front of it. It lets out a low groan. I feel none 
of the rage and malice that the other beasts radiated, no desire for blood and death. There is a sense of 
fear, a sense of sadness. I open myself to it. I see images of torture and starvation. I see the beast locked 
up for all its life here on Earth, a damp cave where little light reaches. Shivering through the night to stay 
warm, always cold and wet. I see the way the Mogadorians pit the beasts against one another, force 
them to fight in order to train, to toughen them and make them mean. 

Henri lets go of me. I can't hold Bernie Kosar any longer. I gently place him in the grass at my feet. I 

haven't felt him move in minutes and I can't tell if he's still alive. I take one step forward and drop to my 

knees. The soldiers yell around us. I don't understand their language but I can tell by their tones that 
they 

are impatient. One swings his sword and a dagger just misses me, a flash of white that flutters and tears 

the front of my shirt. I stay on my knees and I look up at the beast hovering over me. Some weapon is 

fired but it sails over our heads. A warning shot, meant to move the beast to action. The beast quivers. A 

second dagger darts through the air and hits the beast below the elbow of its left arm. It lifts its head 
and 

roars in pain. 

I am sorry,I try to tell it.I am sorry for the life you've been forced to live. You've been wronged. No 
living creature deserves such treatment. You've been forced to endure hell, plucked from your own 
planet to fight a war that isn't yours. Beaten and tortured and starved. The blame for all the pain and 
agony you'v e experienced lies with them. You and I share a common bond. Both wronged by these 



monsters. 



I try with everything to pass along my own images, the things that I've seen and felt. The beast doesn't 
look away. My thoughts, on some level, are reaching it. I show it Lorien, the vast ocean and thick fo rests 
and verdant hills teeming with life and vitality. Animals drinking from the cold blue waters. A proud 
people content to pass the days in harmony. I show it the hell that followed, the slaying of men, women, 
and children. The Mogadorians. Cold-blooded murderers. Draconian killers destroying all that lies within 
their path due to their own recklessness and pathetic beliefs. Destroying even their own planet. Where 
does it end? I show it Sarah, show it every emotion that I've ever felt with her. Happiness and bliss, this 
is how I feel with her. And this is the pain I feel in having to leave her, all because of them.Help me, I say. 
Help me end this death and slaughter. Let us fight together. I have so little left but if you stand with me, 
I'll stand with you. 

The beast lifts its head to the sky and it roars. A roar both long and deep. The Mogadorians can sense 

what is happening and have seen enough. Their weapons begin firing. I look over and one of the 
cannons 

is aimed right at me. It fires and the white death surges forth, but the beast drops its head in time and 

absorbs the shot instead. Its face twists in pain, its eyes squeeze tightly shut, but almost immediately 
they 

snap back open. This time I see the rage. 

I fall face-first in the grass. I'm grazed by something but I don't see what it is. Henri cries out in pain 
behind me and he is flung thirty feet away, his body lying in the mud, face up, smoking. I have no idea 
what has hit him. Something big and deadly. Panic and fear hit me. Not Henri, I think. Please not Henri. 

The beast throws a hard sweeping blow that takes out several of the soldiers and quiets many of their 



guns. Another roar. I look up and see the beast's eyes have turned red, ablaze with fury. Retribution. 
Mutiny. It looks my way once and swiftly rushes off to follow its captors. Guns blaze but many of them 
are quick to be silenced.Kill them all, I think.Fight nobly and honorably and may you kill them all. 

I lift my head. Bernie Kosar is motionless in the grass. Henri, thirty feet away, is motionless as well. I 
place a hand in the grass and pull myself forward, across the field, inch by inch, dragging myself to Henri. 
When I get there his eyes are open slightly; each breath is a fight. Trails of blood run from his mouth and 



nose. I take him into my arms and I pull him into my lap. His body is frail and weak and I can feel him 
dying. His eyes flutter open. He looks at me and lifts his hand and presses it to the side of my face. The 
second he does I begin to cry. 

"I'm here," I say. 

He tries to smile. 

"I'm so sorry, Henri." I say. "I'm so sorry. We should have left when you wanted to." 



"Shh," he says. "It's not your fault." 



"I'm so sorry," I say between sobs. 

"You did great," he says in a whisper. "You did so great. I always knew you would." 
"We have to get you to the school," I say. "Sam could be there." 

"Listen to me, John. Everything," he says. "Everything you need to know, it's all in the Chest. The 
letter." 

"It's not over. We can still make it." 

I can feel him begin to go. I shake him. His eyes reluctantly reopen. A trail of blood runs from his mouth. 
"Coming here, to Paradise, it wasn't by chance." I don't know what he means. "Read the letter." 
"Henri," I say, and reach down and wipe the blood off his chin. 
He looks me in the eye. 

"You are Lorien's Legacy, John. You and the others. The only hope the planet has left. The secrets," he 
says, and is gripped by a fit of coughs. More blood. His eyes close again. "The Chest, John." 

I pull him more tightly to me, squeezing him. His body is going slack. Breaths so shallow that they are 
hardly breaths at all. 



"We'll make it back together, Henri. Me and you, I promise," I say, and close my eyes. 

"Be strong," he says, and is overtaken by slight coughs, though he tries to speak through them. "This 
war.. .Can win.. .Find the others.... Six.... The power of...," he says, and trails off. 

I try to stand with him in my arms but I have nothing left, hardly enough strength to even breathe. Off 
in 

the distance I hear the beast roar. Cannons are still being fired, the sounds and lights of which reach out 
over the stadium bleachers, but as each minute passes less and less of them are being fired until there is 
only one. I lower Henri in my arms. I place my hand to the side of his face and he opens his eyes and 
looks at me for what I know will be the final time. He takes a weak breath and exhales and then slowly 
closes his eyes. 

"I wouldn't have missed a second of it, kiddo. Not for all of Lorien. Not for the whole damn world," he 
says, and when that last word leaves his mouth I know that he is gone. I squeeze him in my arms, 



shaking, crying, despair and hopelessness taking hold. His hand drops lifelessly to the grass. I cup his 
head in my hand and hold it close to my chest, and I rock him back and forth and I cry like I've never 
cried before. The pendant around my neck glows blue, grows heavy for just a split second, and then 



dims to normal. 

I sit in the grass and I hold Henri while the last cannon falls silent. The pain leaves my own body and 
with 

the cold of the night I feel my own self begin to fade. The moon and the stars shine overhead. I hear a 
cackle of laughter carried on the wind. My ears attune to it. I turn my head. Thr ough the dizziness and 
blurry vision I see a scout fifteen feet away from me. Long trench coat, hat pulled to its eyes. It drops the 
coat and takes off the hat to reveal a pale and hairless head. It reaches to the back of its belt and 
removes a bowie knife, the blade of which is no less than twelve inches long. I close my eyes. I don't 
care anymore. The scout's raspy breathing comes my way, ten feet, then five. And then the footsteps 
end. The scout grunts in pain, and begins gurgling. 

I open my eyes, the scout so close that I can smell it. The bowie knife falls from its hand, and there in its 

chest, where I assume its heart must be, is the end of a butcher's knife. The knife is pulled free. The 
scout 

drops to its knees, falls to its side, and explodes into a puff of ash. Behind it, holding the knife in her 

shaky right hand, with tears in her eyes, stands Sarah. She drops the knife and rushes over to me, 

wrapping her arms around me with my arms around Henri. I hold Henri as my own head falls and the 

world dims away into nothingness. The aftermath of war, the school destroyed, the trees fallen and 
heaps 

of ash piled in the grass of the football field and I still hold Henri. And Sarah holds me. 



CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR 



IMAGES FLICKER, EACH ONE BRINGING ITSown sorrow or its own smile. Sometimes both. At 

the very worst an impenetrable and sightless black and at best a happiness so bright that it hurts the 
eyes 

to see, coming and going on some unseen projector perpetually turned by an invisible hand. One, then 
another. The hollow click of the shutter. Now stop. Freeze this frame. Pluck it down and hold it close 
and be damned by what you see. Henri always said: the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow 
it brings. 

A warm summer day in the cool grass with the sun high in the cloudless sky. The air coming off the 

water, carrying the freshness of the sea. A man walks up to the house, briefcase in hand. A younger 
man, 

brown hair cut short, freshly shaven, dressed casually. A sense of nervousness by the way he switches 
his 

briefcase from one hand to the other and the thin layer of sweat glistening on his forehead. He knocks 
at 

the door. My grandfather answers, opens the door for the man to enter, then closes it behind him. I 

resume my romping in the yard. Hadley changing forms, flying, then dodging, then charging. Wrestling 

with one another and laughing until it hurts. The day passing as time only can under the reckless 
abandon 

of childhood's invincibility, of its innocence. 

Fifteen minutes pass. Maybe less. At that age a day can last forev er. The door opens and closes. I look 
up. My grandfather is standing with the man I had seen approach, both of them looking down at me. 

"There is somebody I would like you to meet," he says. 



I stand from the grass and clap my hands together to knock away the dirt. 



"This is Brandon," my grandfather says. "He is your C pan. Do you know what that means?" 



I shake my head. Brandon. That was his name. All these years and only now does it come back to me. 

"It means he's going to be spending a lot of time with you from here on out. The two of you, it means 
you are connected. You are bound to one another. Do you understand?" 

I nod and walk to the man and I offer him my hand as I have seen done many times by grown men 
before. The man smiles and drops to one knee. He takes my small hand in his right and he closes his 
fingers around it. 

"Pleased to meet you, sir," I say. 

Bright, kind eyes full of life look into mine as though offering a promise, a bond, yet I'm too young to 
know what that promise or bond really means. 

He nods and brings his left hand on top of his right, my tiny hand lost somewhere in the middle. He 
nods 

at me, still smiling. 



"My dear child," he says. "The pleasure is all mine." 



I am jolted awake. I lie on my back, my heart racing, breathing heavily as though I had been running. My 
eyes stay closed but I can tell the sun has just risen by the long shadows and the crispness of air in the 
room. Pain returns, my limbs still heavy. With the pain comes another pain, a pain far greater than any 
physical ailment I could ev er be afflicted with: the memory of the hours before. 

I take a deep breath and exhale. A single tear rolls down the side of my face. I keep my eyes closed. An 
irrational hope that if I don't find the day then the day won't find me, that the things in the night will be 

nullified. My body shudders, a silent cry turning into a hard one. I shake my head and let it in. I know 
that 

Henri is dead and that all the hope in the world won't change it. 

I feel movement beside me. I tense myself, try to remain motionless so as not to be detected. A hand 
reaches up and touches the side of my face. A delicate touch done with love. My eyes come open, 

adjusting to the postdawn light until the ceiling of a foreign room comes into focus. I hav e no idea where 
I 

am, nor how I could have gotten here. Sarah is sitting next to me. She brings her hand to the side of my 
face and traces my brow with her thumb. She leans down and kisses me, a soft lingering kiss that I wish I 
could bottle and save for all time. She pulls away and I take a deep breath and close my eyes and kiss 
her on the forehead. 



"Where are we?" I ask. 



"A hotel thirty miles from Paradise." 



"How did I get here?" 
"Sam drove us," she says. 

"I mean from the school. What happened? I remember that you were with me last night, but I don't 
remember a thing after," I say. "It almost seems like a dream." 



"I waited on the field with you until Mark arrived and he carried you to Sam's truck. I couldn't stay 
hidden any longer. Being in the school without knowing what was happening out there was killing me. 
And I felt like I could help somehow." 

"You certainly helped," I say. "You saved my life." 

"I killed an alien," she says, as though the fact still hasn't settled in. 

She wraps her arms around me, her hand resting on the back of my head. I try to sit up. I make it 



halfway on my own and then Sarah helps me the rest of the way, pushing on my back but being careful 

not to touch the wound left by the knife. I swing my feet over the edge of the bed and reach down and 

feel the scars around my ankle, counting them with the tips of my fingers. Still only three, and in this 
way I 

know that Six has survived. I had already accepted the fate of the rest of my days being spent alone, an 

itinerant wanderer with no place to go. But I won't be alone. Six is still here, still with me, my tie to a 
past 

world. 

"Is Six okay?" 

"Yes," she says. "She's been stabbed and shot but she seems to be doing okay now. I don't think she 
would have survived had Sam not carried her to the truck." 

"Where is she?" 

"In the room next door, with Sam and Mark." 

I stand. My muscles and joints ache in protest, everything stiff and sore. I am wearing a clean T-shirt, a 
pair of mesh shorts. My skin is fresh with the smell of soap. The cuts have been cleaned and bandaged, a 
few of them stitched. 

"Did you do all of this?" I ask. 

"Most of it. The stitches were hard. We only had the ones Henri put in your head to go on as an 
example. Sam helped with them." 



I look at Sarah sitting on the bed, her legs pulled underneath her. Something else catches my eye, a 
small 

mass that has shifted beneath the blanket at the foot of the bed. I tense, and immediately my mind 
returns 

to the weasels that sped across the gym. Sarah sees what I am looking at and smiles. She crawls to the 
bottom of the bed on her hands and knees. 

"There's somebody here who wants to say hello," she says, then takes the corner of the blanket and 
gently peels it back to reveal Bernie Kosar, sleeping away. A metal splint goes the length of his front leg, 
and his body is covered with cuts and gashes that, like mine, have been cleaned and are already 
beginning to heal. His eyes slowly open and adjust, eyes rimmed with red, full of exhaustion. He keeps 
his head on the bed but his tail gives a subtle wag, softly thumping against the mattress. 

"Bernie," I say, and drop to my knees before him. I place my hand softly on his head. I can't stop 
smiling and tears of joy surface. His small body is curled into a ball, head resting on his front paws, his 
eyes taking me in, battle scarred and wounded but still here to tell the tale. 

"Bernie Kosar, you made it through. I owe my life to you," I say, and kiss the top of his head. 



Sarah runs her hand down the length of his back. 
"I carried him to the truck while Mark carried you. " 
"Mark. I'm sorry I ever doubted him," I say. 

She lifts one of Bernie Kosar's ears. He turns and sniffs at her hand and then licks it. "So, is it true what 
Mark said, that Bernie Kosar grew to thirty feet tall and killed a beast almost double his size?" 

I smile. "A beast triple his size." 

Bernie Kosar looks at me. Liar, he says. I look down and wink at him. I stand back up and look at 
Sarah. 

"All of this," I say. "All of this has happened so fast. How are you handling it?" 

She nods. "Handling what? The fact that I've fallen in love with an alien, which I only found out about 
three days ago, and then just happened to walk headlong into the middle of a war? Yeah, I'm handling 
that okay." 

I smile at her. "You're an angel." 

"Nah," she says. "I'm just a girl crazy in love." 

She gets up from the bed and wraps her arms around me and we stand in the center of the room 
holding 



one another. 



"You really have to leave, don't you?" 
I nod. 

She takes a deep breath and exhales shakily, willing herself not to cry. More tears in the past 
twenty-four hours than I have ever witnessed in all the years of my life. 

"I don't know where you have to go or what you have to do, but I'll wait for you, John. Every bit of my 
heart belongs to you, whether you ask for it or not." 

I pull her to me. "And mine belongs to you," I say. 



I walk across the room. Sitting on top of the desk are the Loric Chest, three packed bags, Henri's 

computer, and all the money from the last withdrawal he made at the bank. Sarah must have rescued 
the 

Chest from the home-ec room. I place my hand on it. All the secrets, Henri had said. All of them 
contained within this. In time I'll open it and discover them, but that time is certainly not now. And what 
did he mean about Paradise, that our coming wasn't by chance? 

"Did you pack my bags?" I ask Sarah, who is standing behind me. 

"Yes, and it was probably the hardest thing I ever had to do." 



I lift my bag from the table. Beneath it is a manila envelope carrying my name across the front of it. 



"What is this?" I ask. 

"I don't know. I found it in Henri's bedroom. We went there after leaving the school and tried to grab 
everything we could; then we came here." 

I open the envelope and pull out the contents. All of the documents Henri had created for me: birth 
certificates, social security cards, visas, and so on. I count through them. Seventeen different identities, 
seventeen different ages. On the very front sheet is a sticky note in Henri's writing. It reads, "Just in 
case." After the last sheet is another sealed envelope, across which Henri has written my name. A letter, 
the one he must have been talking about just before he died. I don't have the heart to read it now. 



I look out the window of the hotel room. A light snow sifts down from the low, gray clouds overhead. 
The ground is too warm for any of it to stick. Sarah's car and Sam's father's blue truck are parked 
beside each other in the lot. As I stand looking down at them a knock sounds at the door. Sarah opens it 



and Sam and Mark walk into the room; Six limps behind them. Sam hugs me, says he's sorry. 



"Thank you," I say. 

"How do you feel?" Six asks. She is no longer wearing the suit but is now dressed in the pair of jeans 
she wore when I first saw her, and one of Henri's sweatshirts. 

I shrug. "I'm okay. Sore and stiff. My body feels heavy. " 

"The heaviness is from the dagger. It'll eventually wear off, though." 

"How badly were you stabbed?" I ask. 

She lifts her shirt and shows me the gash in her side, then a different one on her back. All told, she was 

stabbed three times last night, and that's not to mention the various cuts along the rest of her body, or 
the 

shot that left a deep gash in her right thigh, now wrapped tightly with gauze and tape, the reason for her 
limp. She tells me that by the time we made it back it was too late to be healed by the stone. It amazes 
me that she is even alive. 

Sam and Mark are wearing the same clothes as the day before, both filthy and covered in mud and dirt 
with smatterings of blood mixed in. Both with heavy eyes as though they've yet to sleep. Mark stands 
behind Sam, shifting his weight uncomfortably. 

"Sam, I always knew you were a wrecking machine," I say. 



He laughs uncertainly. "Are you okay?" 



"Yeah, I'm fine," I say. "How about you?" 



"Doing okay." 



I look over his shoulder at Mark. 



"Sarah told me you carried me off the field last night." 
Mark shrugs. "I was happy to help." 
"You saved my life, Mark." 

He looks me in the eye. "I think every one of us saved somebody at some point last night. Hell, Six 
saved me on three separate occasions. And you saved my two dogs on Saturday. I say we're even." 

I somehow manage to smile. "Fair enough," I say. "I'm just happy to find out you're not the dick I 
thought you were." 



He half grins. "Let's just say that had I known you were an alien and could kick my ass at will, I might 
have been a little nicer to you that first day." 

Six walks across the room and looks at my bags atop the table. 

"We really should get going," she says, and then looks at me with implicit concern, her face softening. 
"There's really only one thing left undone. We weren't sure what you wanted us to do." 

I nod. I don't need to ask to know what she is talking about. I look at Sarah. It's going to happen much 
sooner than I thought. My stomach turns. I feel as though I could vomit. Sarah reaches out and takes 
hold of my hand. 

"Where is he?" 



The ground is damp with the melting snow. I hold Sarah's hand in mine and we pass through the woods 
in silence, a mile away from the hotel. Sam and Mark walk in the lead, following the muddy footprints 
they created a few hours before. Up ahead I see a slight clearing, in the center of which Henri's body has 
been laid out on a slab of wood. He is wrapped in the gray blanket pulled from his bed. I walk to him. 
Sarah follows and places a hand on my shoulder. The others stand behind me. I pull the blanket down to 
see him. His eyes are closed, his face is ashen gray, and his lips are blue from the cold. I kiss his 
forehead. 



"What do you want to do, John?" Six asks. "We can bury him if you want. We can also cremate him." 
"How can we cremate him?" 
"I can create a fire." 

"I thought you could only control the weather." 
"Not the weather. The elements." 

I look up at her soft face, concern written upon it but also the stress of time at our having to leave 
before 

reinforcements arrive. I don't answer. I look away and squeeze Henri a final time with my face close to 
his and I lose myself to grief. 

"I'm so sorry, Henri," I whisper in his ear. I close my eyes. "I love you. I wouldn't have missed a 



second of it, either. Not for anything," I whisper. "I'm going to take you back yet. Somehow I am going 
to get you back to Lorien. We always joked about it but you were my father, the best father I could have 
ever asked for. I'll never forget you, not for a minute for as long as I live. I love you, Henri. I always 



did." 



I let go of him, pull the blanket back over his face, and lay him gently on the wooden slab. I stand and 
hug Sarah. She holds me until I stop crying. I wipe the tears away with the back of my hand and I nod at 
Six. 

Sam helps me clear away the sticks and leaves and then we lay Henri's body on the ground so as not to 

dilute his ash with anything else. Sam lights an edge of the blanket and Six makes the fire rage from 
there. 

We watch it burn, not a dry eye among us. Even Mark cries. Nobody says a word. When the flames end 

I gather the ashes in a coffee can that Mark was astute enough to bring from the hotel. I'll get something 

better the second we stop. When we walk back I put the can on the dashboard of Sam's dad's truck. I 

feel comforted to know that Henri will still travel with us, that he'll look out over the roads while we 
leave 

another town as the two of us have done so many times before. 

We load our belongings into the back of the truck. Along with Six's things and mine, Sam has also 
loaded in two bags of his own. At first I'm confused, but then I realize that between him and Six some 
agreement has been made that Sam will come with us. And I'm happy for that. Sarah and I walk back 
into the hotel room. The second the door closes she takes my hand and turns me towards her. 

"My heart is breaking," she says. "I want to be strong for you right now but the thought of you leaving is 
killing me inside." 

I kiss her on the head. 



"My heart is broken already," I say. "The second I get settled I'll write. And I'll do my best to call when 
I know it is safe." 

Six pokes her head in the doorway. 
"We really have to go," she says. 

I nod. She closes the door. Sarah lifts her face to mine and we kiss standing there in the hotel room. The 
thought of the Mogadorians returning before we've left, and thus putting her in danger yet again, is the 
only source of strength I can find. Else I might collapse. Else I might stay forever. 

Bernie Kosar still lies waiting at the foot of the bed. He wags his tail when I carefully take him into my 

arms and carry him outside to the truck. Six starts the truck and lets it idle. I turn and look up at the 
hotel 

and am saddened that it's not the house, and that I know I'll never see it again. Its peeling wooden 
clapboards, broken windows, black shingles warped from excessive sun exposure and rain. It looks like 
Paradise, I once told Henri. But that will no longer hold true. Paradise lost. 

I turn and nod to Six. She climbs into the truck, closes the door, and waits. 

Sam and Mark shake hands but I don't hear what they say to each other. Sam climbs into the truck and 
waits with Six. I shake Mark's hand. 

"I owe you more than I'll ever be able to repay," I say to Mark. 



"You don't owe me a thing," Mark says. 
"Not true," I say. "Someday." 

I look away. I can feel myself wanting to collapse under the sadness of leaving. My resolv e is being held 
by a tattered string ready to snap. 

I nod. "I'll see you again someday." 

"Be safe out there." 

I take Sarah into my arms and squeeze her tightly, never wanting to let go. 

"I'll come back to you," I say. "I promise you, if it's the last thing I do I'll come back to you." 

Her face is buried in my neck. She nods. 

"I'll count the minutes until you do," she says. 

One last kiss. I set her on the ground and I open the door to the truck. My eyes never leave hers. She 



covers her mouth and her nose with her hands pressed together, neither one of us able to look away. I 
close the door. Six puts the truck in reverse and pulls out of the parking lot, comes to a stop, puts it in 
gear. Mark and Sarah walk to the end of the lot to watch us on our way, tears streaming down both 
sides of Sarah's face. I turn in my seat and watch from the rear window. I lift my hand to wave and Mark 
waves back but Sarah just watches. I watch her for as long as I can, growing smaller, one indistinct blur 
fading in the distance. The truck slows and turns and both of them vanish from sight. I turn back around 
and I watch the fields pass and I close my eyes and I picture Sarah's face and I smile.We'll be together 
yet, I tell her. And until that day you'll be in my heart and my every thought. 

Bernie Kosar lifts his head and rests it in my lap and I place my hand upon his back. The truck bounces 
down the road, driving south. The four of us, together, heading for the next town. Wherever that might 
be.
